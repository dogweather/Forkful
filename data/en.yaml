      Debuggers help you understand your program's "flow"; 
      making sure its logic plays out as expected. For example, 
      you can see the values of your variables at any point in 
      the code. 

      I find them useful for the most difficult bugs. IMO, 
      their helpfulness really depends on the particular language, 
      your personal working style, the quality of the debugging
      tool itself.
