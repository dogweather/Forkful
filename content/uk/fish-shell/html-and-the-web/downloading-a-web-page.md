## How to: (Як це зробити:)
Let's use `curl` in Fish to download a webpage:

```fish
curl -o mypage.html https://example.com
```
Sample output:

```plaintext
% Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100  1256  100  1256    0     0   6358      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--  6358
```
Now `mypage.html` holds the HTML content of the example website.

## Deep Dive (Детальніше)
In the early days of the internet, downloading web pages was mostly manual. Tools like `wget` and `curl` came along to streamline the process. `curl` is versatile, supporting different protocols and methods. While `curl` is the go-to in scripting, GUI-based apps like `Postman` also let you download web content, giving users interactive control.

If you want to do more than just download, such as parsing HTML, you might combine `curl` with other tools. Fish makes it easy to pipe `curl` output to processors like `jq` or `grep`.

Example with processing:
```fish
curl -s https://example.com | grep 'some-pattern'
```
