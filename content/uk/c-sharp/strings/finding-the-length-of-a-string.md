## How to: (Як робити:)
```C#
string example = "Привіт, світ!";
int length = example.Length;

Console.WriteLine(length); // Outputs: 13
```
```C#
string emptyString = String.Empty;
int emptyLength = emptyString.Length;

Console.WriteLine(emptyLength); // Outputs: 0
```

## Deep Dive (Занурення у глибину)
In C#, strings are immutable and represented by the `System.String` class. The `Length` property is integral to this class and returns the number of `Char` objects in the string, which is essentially the count of UTF-16 code units. Historically, as programming languages evolved, various methods to measure strings were developed, but in C#, `.Length` has been the go-to since its inception.

Other methods, like `StringInfo.LengthInTextElements`, can handle strings with combined characters (like emojis or accented characters) more accurately when counting user-perceived characters, as opposed to code units.

Under the hood, `Length` property is a simple and fast operation, retrieving a value pre-stored in the string object without actually iterating through it.
