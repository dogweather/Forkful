## What & Why? (Що та Чому?)
Every now and then, a coder gets to kick off a new project. It's fresh, exciting, and often starts with a simple "Hello, World!". We do it to solve problems, to learn, or sometimes just for the fun of tinkering with ideas.

## How to: (Як це зробити:)
Let's spin up a new C project. Here's a basic but mighty 'Hello, World!' in C, the mother tongue of programming:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Привіт, світ!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

Compile and run. Your terminal should greet you:

```
Привіт, світ!
```

## Deep Dive (Занурення у глибину)
Starting a new project hasn't always been this simple. In ancient times (think 1970s), programming meant punch cards and time-sharing systems. Today, we've got Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and powerful tools like `gcc` for compiling C.

Alternatives? Other languages, sure. But often the right tool for the job is a fast, compiled language like C. It deals closely with system hardware and is great for performance-critical apps.

Implementation means setting the project up properly. Structuring your files, choosing a build system (like `make`), and considering version control (git is your friend here) from the get-go can save headaches later.
