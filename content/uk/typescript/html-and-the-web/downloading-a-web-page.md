## How to (Як це зробити):
To download a web page in TypeScript, you'll need `node-fetch`. Install it with `npm install node-fetch`. Here's how you use it:

```typescript
import fetch from 'node-fetch';

async function downloadPage(url: string): Promise<string> {
    try {
        const response = await fetch(url);
        return response.ok ? await response.text() : 'Failed to load page';
    } catch (error) {
        return 'Error: ' + error;
    }
}

downloadPage('https://www.example.com').then(console.log);
```

Sample output for a successful page load might be the HTML contents, and for an error, 'Error: TypeError: Failed to fetch'.

## Deep Dive (Поглиблене Вивчення):
Historically, downloading a web page was often done with XMLHttpRequest in the browser, or with modules like `http` or `https` in Node.js. `fetch` API provides a cleaner, promise-based way to make web requests, and `node-fetch` is essentially node's implementation of what `fetch` does in the browser.

Alternatives to `node-fetch` include `axios` or libraries like `got`. Each has its pros and cons in terms of features, syntax, and performance.

Understanding HTTP status codes and headers is crucial. They tell you if your request was successful (`200` series), redirected (`300` series), had client errors (`400` series), or server errors (`500` series).
