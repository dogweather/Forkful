## What & Why?
"Що і Чому?"

Comparing two dates helps us figure out their order and how far apart they are. Programmers do it to manage events, reminders, or anything related to time-dependent features.

## How to:
"Як це зробити:"

Swift's `Date` objects can be compared using comparison operators. Here's how to do it:

```Swift
import Foundation

let now = Date()
let tomorrow = Calendar.current.date(byAdding: .day, value: 1, to: now)!

// Check if one date comes before the other
if now < tomorrow {
    print("Now is earlier than tomorrow.")
} else {
    print("Now is not earlier than tomorrow.")
}

// Check if two dates are the same moment
if now == tomorrow {
    print("Now is the same as tomorrow.")
} else {
    print("Now is not the same as tomorrow.")
}

// Comparing dates for sorting
let dates = [tomorrow, now]
let sortedDates = dates.sorted(by: { $0 < $1 })
print("Sorted dates: \(sortedDates)")
```

Sample output:

```
Now is earlier than tomorrow.
Now is not the same as tomorrow.
Sorted dates: [current date's timestamp, tomorrow's date's timestamp]
```

## Deep Dive
"Детальний огляд"

In the old times of Objective-C, we compared dates using `NSDate` and methods like `compare:`. Now, with Swift, comparison operators make the code cleaner. 

Alternatives to simple comparison include using `Calendar` and `DateComponents` for more complex operations, like comparing only specific components (just the day, month, or year). 

For implementation, Swift uses `TimeInterval` (a `Double` representing seconds) to measure exact differences between two `Date` objects.
