## What & Why? (Що і Чому?)
Creating a temporary file means making a file that you'll use briefly and then toss out, like a scratch pad. Programmers do it for safe storage away from the main file system, often for data processing, caching, or as a workspace during computation.

## How to: (Як зробити:)
Swift has the `FileManager` class to help out. Here's a quick example:

```swift
import Foundation

func createTemporaryFile() {
    let tempDirectoryURL = FileManager.default.temporaryDirectory
    let tempFileURL = tempDirectoryURL.appendingPathComponent("tmpfile").appendingPathExtension("txt")
    
    let content = "Temporary data here"
    do {
        try content.write(to: tempFileURL, atomically: true, encoding: .utf8)
        print("Temporary file created at \(tempFileURL.path)")
    } catch {
        print(error)
    }
}

createTemporaryFile()
```

Sample output:

```
Temporary file created at /var/folders/.../tmpfile.txt
```

## Deep Dive (Поглиблений Розгляд):
Historically, temporary files date back to the early days of computing, used to manage limited storage space and reduce memory usage. Alternatives to temporary files include in-memory storage or databases, but these may be volatile or impractical for large data sets. In Swift, `FileManager` ensures that temp files go in the correct directory, which is unique per user and session, minimizing security risks and avoiding clashes.
