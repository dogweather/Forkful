## How to (Як це зробити):
```Clojure
(defn debug-example []
  (let [x 42]
    (println "Debug: x =" x)
    ; ... more code
))

(debug-example)
; prints: Debug: x = 42
```

```Clojure
; Advanced usage with `tap>`
(defn debug-advanced-example []
  (let [y 108]
    (tap> {"Debug y" y}) ; places the map on the tap list
    ; ... more code
  )
)

(add-tap (fn [v] (println "Tap debug:" v)))

(debug-advanced-example)
; Tap debug: {"Debug y" 108}
```

## Deep Dive (Поглиблене занурення):
Before integrated debuggers, printing to console was often the only way to debug. Now, `println` in Clojure is straightforward for simple cases, but can clutter your output. Clojure's `tap>` and `add-tap` functions provide a more sophisticated way to handle debug info.

`tap>` sends values to a 'tap list', which any number of 'tap functions' can consume. It's like a debug channel that doesn’t interfere with your main output stream. Implementing `tap>`, you can set up a separate logging window or filter messages, making it powerful for complex applications.

Real-world usage might include timestamping messages or logging to a file, all without disturbing your program's standard operation flow.
