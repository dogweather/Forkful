## What & Why?
(## Що і Чому?)
Searching and replacing text in JavaScript is about finding strings and swapping them out. Programmers do it to change data, clean it up, or manipulate content dynamically.

## How to:
(## Як робити:)
Here's a basic example. We've got a string and we want to replace "cat" with "dog".

```javascript
let text = "The quick brown cat jumps over the lazy dog.";
let newText = text.replace("cat", "dog");
console.log(newText); // Output: The quick brown dog jumps over the lazy dog.
```

Now, let's say we want to replace all occurrences, not just the first one:

```javascript
let text = "Cat: An animal. Cat: Also a pet.";
let newText = text.replaceAll("Cat", "Dog");
console.log(newText); // Output: Dog: An animal. Dog: Also a pet.
```

RegEx time! What if our search is complex? RegEx to the rescue:

```javascript
let text = "I have 2 apples and 5 oranges.";
let newText = text.replace(/\d+/g, (match) => match * 2);
console.log(newText); // Output: I have 4 apples and 10 oranges.
```

## Deep Dive
(## Поглиблений Розділ)
Searching and replacing text has been around since the earliest days of computing. JavaScript handles this using the `.replace()` and `.replaceAll()` methods, with the latter being added in ES2021 for convenience in replacing all occurrences without a RegEx.

There are alternatives to `.replace()` and `.replaceAll()`, like splitting a string into an array, modifying the elements, and then joining them back together. But these methods are more verbose and can be less efficient.

From an implementation perspective, regex-based searching in JavaScript is powerful but can cost performance if overused or misused. So, understanding RegEx is crucial for complex string operations.
