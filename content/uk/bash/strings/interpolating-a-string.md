## How to: (Як це зробити:)
In Bash, place the variable name inside `${}` or directly after a `$` within double quotes.

```Bash
# Basic variable interpolation
name="Olena"
echo "Hello, $name!"

# Using braces for clarity or when needed
greeting="Hello, ${name}!"
echo $greeting
```
Output:
```
Hello, Olena!
Hello, Olena!
```

To combine variables or include a variable next to other characters without spaces:

```Bash
# Concatenate variables
user="Olena"
action="logged in"
echo "$user$action"

# Variable with a suffix
file_count=3
echo "You have ${file_count} files."
```
Output:
```
Olena logged in
You have 3 files.
```

## Deep Dive (Поглиблений огляд)
String interpolation is not unique to Bash; it's a feature of many programming languages, used since the early days to ease code readability and functionality. In Bash, unlike languages like PHP or Perl, you don't need a special syntax (like `.` or `,`) to concatenate strings and variables; instead, it's mainly a feature of how the shell expands variables within strings. As an alternative to direct interpolation, you might use command substitution (using the `$(...)` syntax) to place command output directly into a string.

```Bash
# Command substitution example
echo "The date is $(date)."
```

In terms of performance, interpolation may be slightly faster than other techniques, like multiple `echo` statements or the concatenation of variables using command substitution, because it's handled directly by the shell's parser. But remember, with great power comes great responsibility – interpolating user input directly can lead to security issues like injection attacks unless properly sanitized.
