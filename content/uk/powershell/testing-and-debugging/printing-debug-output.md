## How to: (Як це зробити:)
PowerShell's basic command for output is `Write-Host`, but for debug-specific output, we use `Write-Debug`. Remember, `Write-Debug` is silenced by default. To see the debug messages, you need to set `$DebugPreference` or use the `-Debug` parameter.

```PowerShell
# Basic output
Write-Host "This is a regular message."

# Debug output
Write-Debug "This is a debug message."

# To see the debug message without changing global preference
Write-Debug "Here's a debug message with -Debug parameter." -Debug

# To change the preference globally
$DebugPreference = 'Continue'
Write-Debug "Now you see all debug messages!"
```

Output for this would be:

```
This is a regular message.
DEBUG: This is a debug message.
DEBUG: Here's a debug message with -Debug parameter.
DEBUG: Now you see all debug messages!
```

## Deep Dive (Поглиблений аналіз):
Once upon a time, debugging was about squashing physical bugs that shorted circuits. Today we've got more sophisticated methods to track down errors. `Write-Debug` follow this tradition by allowing developers to peek inside their running scripts.

There are other ways to debug in PowerShell. Besides `Write-Debug`, you can leverage `Write-Verbose` for detailed info, `Write-Warning` for potential issues, and `Write-Error` for actual errors. Tools like the PowerShell debugger, breakpoints, and the Integrated Scripting Environment (ISE) are for more complex scenarios.

`Write-Debug` outputs to the debug stream, one of the six streams in PowerShell. This design lets you control where and how much information you spill out. It's all about managing noise – ensuring that you get the signals you need without the irrelevant chatter.
