## How to: (Як зробити:)
To download a web page in Java, use `java.net.HttpURLConnection`. Here’s a concise example:

```java
import java.io.*;
import java.net.HttpURLConnection;
import java.net.URL;

public class WebPageDownloader {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        URL url = new URL("http://www.example.com");
        HttpURLConnection connection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
        
        try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(connection.getInputStream()))) {
            String line;
            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
                System.out.println(line);
            }
        } finally {
            connection.disconnect();
        }
    }
}
```

Sample output:

```
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Example Domain</title>
    ...
</html>
```

## Deep Dive (Поглиблений аналіз):
Downloading web pages has come a long way from the days of raw socket connections. Now, `HttpURLConnection` is the basic Java class for it, but it’s not the only tool. Libraries like Apache HttpClient or Jsoup provide more functionality and are more user-friendly.

There’s a trade-off: `HttpURLConnection` is built-in and doesn’t need extra jars, while third-party libraries require managing dependencies but can simplify tasks like handling cookies, or managing sessions.

Historically, Java’s `HttpURLConnection` has been criticized for being clunky and less intuitive compared to what modern libraries offer. Yet it remains a go-to option for many, especially when sticking to the standard library is appealing or for simpler tasks where an external library might be overkill.
