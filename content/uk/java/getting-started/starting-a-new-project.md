## How to: (Як це зробити:)
Let’s kick off with a simple Hello World in Java, assuming you have Java installed and your IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is prepped for action.

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Привіт, світ!");
    }
}
```

Sample output:
```
Привіт, світ!
```

If you are using Maven or Gradle, you’d initialize your project differently. Here’s a quick Maven setup:

```shell
mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.yourcompany.helloworld -DartifactId=hello-world -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DinteractiveMode=false
cd hello-world
mvn package
java -cp target/hello-world-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.yourcompany.helloworld.App
```

## Deep Dive (Поглиблений Розбір)
Starting a new project in Java hasn't always been straightforward. In the early 2000s, IDEs weren't as powerful, and we mostly used text editors and manual builds. Now, with IDEs like Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, and tools like Maven and Gradle, it's way easier.

However, it's not just about picking a tool; it’s understanding what fits the project. Maven is great for standard-based projects with stable dependencies, while Gradile fits the bill for a more flexible and scriptable build process. Historically, Maven came first, and many companies still use it, but Gradle is gaining popularity, especially with the Android crowd.

Knowing about project structure is vital. A typical Java project includes source files in `src/main/java`, class files in `target/classes`, and libraries in `lib`. Tests live in `src/test/java`. Maven and Gradle also handle dependencies, so you don't need to manually source your jars.
