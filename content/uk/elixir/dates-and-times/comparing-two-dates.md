## What & Why? (Що та Чому?)
Comparing two dates means checking how they relate to each other—are they the same, is one earlier, or is it later. Programmers need this for scheduling events, data validity, timelines, expiries, and the logic of everyday life infiltrating code.

## How to: (Як це зробити:)
```elixir
# Assuming you've got Elixir installed and you're inside an iex session

# Let's use Timex, which is a popular Elixir library for dates
{:ok, timex} = Application.ensure_all_started(:timex)

# Suppose we have two dates
date1 = ~D[2023-04-15]
date2 = ~D[2023-05-20]

# We can compare them with Timex
comparison_result = Timex.compare(date1, date2)
case comparison_result do
  1 -> IO.puts "Date1 is later."
  0 -> IO.puts "Dates are equal."
  -1 -> IO.puts "Date1 is earlier."
end
```
Sample output:
```
"Date1 is earlier."
```

## Deep Dive (Детальний опис)
In Elixir, comparing dates wasn't always straightforward. Before version 1.3, we lacked the luxury of the built-in `DateTime` module. Back then, third-party libraries like `Timex` were essential. Now, Elixir's standard library has good support, but `Timex` still stands strong for its extended functionalities and ease of use.

Alternatives to `Timex` include using the `DateTime` module or the `:calendar` module, both part of Elixir’s standard library. The `DateTime.compare/2` function can handle most of your date comparison needs without external dependencies.

Comparing dates boils down to comparing timestamps or year/month/day tuples. Elixir (and Erlang, the language Elixir is built upon) uses an internal calendar system to manage dates, ensuring accurate comparisons across different calendar types.
