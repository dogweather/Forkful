## Як це зробити:
```elixir
original_text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
search_pattern = "lazy"
replacement = "energetic"

fixed_text = String.replace(original_text, search_pattern, replacement)

IO.puts fixed_text
```
Output:
```
The quick brown fox jumps over the energetic dog
```

## Занурення у глибину
Originally, searching and replacing text was a feature in text editors, evolving as a handy tool for programming. Elixir's `String.replace/3` function makes it straightforward, but Regex can be used when more complex patterns are involved. Alternatives include `String.replace_leading/3` or `String.replace_trailing/3` for more specific use cases. Under the hood, the `String` module handles Unicode-compliant character data, which means your search and replace operations are reliable across various languages and special characters.
