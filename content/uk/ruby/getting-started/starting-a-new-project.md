## What & Why? (Що та Чому?)
Starting a new project (ініціація нового проекту) means setting up the initial structure for your code – imagine it's the foundation of a house you're about to build. Programmers start new projects to turn ideas into running code, making the abstract concrete.

## How to: (Як це зробити:)
```ruby
# Install the latest version of Ruby (if you don't have it yet)
# $ sudo apt-get install ruby-full

# Starting a new project is simple. Create a directory and initialize it:

# Create a project directory
$ mkdir my_new_project
$ cd my_new_project

# Initialize with Bundler (if using) to manage dependencies
$ bundle init

# Sample output:
# Writing new Gemfile to /path/to/your/new/project/Gemfile

# Create a basic Ruby file
$ touch main.rb

# Edit your main.rb to include some basic Ruby code
$ echo "puts 'Hello, Україно!'" > main.rb

# Run your Ruby file
$ ruby main.rb

# Sample output:
Hello, Україно!
```

## Deep Dive (Поглиблений Аналіз):
Starting a new project isn’t just about the initial setup; it's about beginning with good practices. Historically, tools like `bundler` have become essential, as managing dependencies and ensuring a consistent environment for your Ruby application is crucial.

Alternatives like creating a project in an IDE (such as RubyMine) or using `rails new` for a Ruby on Rails app exist but tailor to more specific use cases.

Diving into implementation, starting off with version control (like initializing a Git repository with `git init`) is a best practice. Additionally, consider a version manager like `rbenv` or `rvm` to maintain different Ruby versions for various projects.
