## What & Why? (מה ולמה?)
HTTP requests are how we ask for stuff on the web. Programmers send them to get data, post data, and interact with web services. Essential for web development and APIs.

## How to: (איך לעשות:)
Here’s a quick code snippet using `requests` in Python:

```python
import requests

# Get request
response = requests.get('https://api.github.com')
print(response.status_code)
print(response.json())

# Post request
payload = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}
post_response = requests.post('https://httpbin.org/post', data=payload)
print(post_response.text)
```
Sample output:

```
200
{'current_user_url': 'https://api.github.com/user', ... etc ... }
{
  "args": {}, 
  "data": "", 
  "files": {}, 
  "form": {
    "key1": "value1",
    "key2": "value2"
  },
  ... etc ...
}
```

## Deep Dive (עומק השקעה)
HTTP has been around since 1991 - Tim Berners-Lee's invention. Today, besides `requests`, you might see `http.client` or third-party packages like `httpx`. Each has its purpose. `requests` is friendly and high-level; `http.client` offers lower-level control. When sending HTTP requests, consider what data you send. With `POST`, data is in the body; `GET` goes in the URL.
