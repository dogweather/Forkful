## What & Why? (何となぜ？)
Random numbers are values generated by a process that cannot be predicted before running a program. Programmers use them for games, simulations, and in security for generating unpredictable data.

## How to: (やり方)
In Elm, you use the `Random` module. Here's a quick spin:

```Elm
import Html exposing (Html, button, div, text)
import Random

main =
  Html.program
    { init = init
    , view = view
    , update = update
    , subscriptions = subscriptions
    }

-- Model
type alias Model =
    { randomNumber : Int }

init : ( Model, Cmd Msg )
init =
    ( Model 0, Random.generate NewRandomNumber (Random.int 1 100) )

-- Update
type Msg
    = NewRandomNumber Int

update : Msg -> Model -> ( Model, Cmd Msg )
update msg model =
    case msg of
        NewRandomNumber newNumber ->
            ( { model | randomNumber = newNumber }, Cmd.none )

-- View
view : Model -> Html Msg
view model =
    div []
        [ div [] [ text ("Random number: " ++ String.fromInt model.randomNumber) ]
        , button [ onClick (Random.generate NewRandomNumber (Random.int 1 100)) ] [ text "Generate" ]
        ]

-- Subscriptions
subscriptions : Model -> Sub Msg
subscriptions model =
    Sub.none

```
This will show a button that generates a random number between 1 and 100 when clicked.

## Deep Dive (詳細な解説)
Elm's current way of generating random numbers is pure; it uses a seed-based system to ensure reproducibility and functional purity. Historically, other languages use impure functions like `Math.random()` in JavaScript, which Elm avoids.

Elm's random number generation process always returns a `Cmd`, which represents an effectful operation. This is different from simply returning a new value, as it requires the Elm architecture to handle updates.

Alternatives to the `Random` module include ports (interacting with JavaScript) or native modules (though not officially supported for community packages in Elm 0.19).
