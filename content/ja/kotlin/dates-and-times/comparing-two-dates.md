## What & Why? (何となぜ？)
Comparing two dates in Kotlin means to check if one date comes before or after another or if they're the same. Programmers do this to handle events, schedules, deadlines, or time-sensitive features in their apps.

## How to: (方法)
Kotlin uses the `java.time.LocalDate` class for date comparisons. Here's how:

```kotlin
import java.time.LocalDate

fun main() {
    val date1 = LocalDate.of(2023, 4, 1)
    val date2 = LocalDate.now()

    println(date1.isBefore(date2))  // Check if date1 is before date2
    println(date1.isAfter(date2))   // Check if date1 is after date2
    println(date1.isEqual(date2))   // Check if both dates are equal
}
```
Sample output if run on April 2, 2023:  
```
true
false
false
```

## Deep Dive (掘り下げ)
Kotlin relies on `java.time` (introduced in Java 8) for date operations. Before Java 8, `java.util.Date` and `java.util.Calendar` were common but flawed due to design and thread-safety issues. Alternatives include Joda-Time, but `java.time` is now the recommended approach.

Comparing dates is crucial for sorting, scheduling tasks, or validating time periods. Kotlin enhances Java's approach with extension functions and better null-safety.
