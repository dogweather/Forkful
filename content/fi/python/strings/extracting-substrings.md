## What & Why? (Mitä & Miksi?)
Substring extraction is about pulling specific parts from a string. Programmers do it to process or analyze text data - like extracting usernames from email addresses.

## How to: (Kuinka tehdä:)
```Python
# Basic substring extraction with slice notation
text = "hello world"
substring = text[1:5]  # Extracts 'ello'
print(substring)

# Extracting from the start and to the end
start = text[:5]  # Extracts 'hello'
end = text[6:]   # Extracts 'world'
print(start, end)

# Using a step in slicing
steps = text[::2]  # Every second character: 'hlowrd'
print(steps)
```
Output:
```
ello
hello world
hlowrd
```

## Deep Dive (Syväsukellus)
Substring extraction has been a part of programming since the early days of string manipulation. Python's slice notation is borrowed from older languages but with a more readable syntax. Alternatives to slicing include using `substr()` in earlier languages or regular expressions for complex patterns. When slicing, Python creates a new string, and the original is left unchanged, promoting immutability and making code less error-prone.
