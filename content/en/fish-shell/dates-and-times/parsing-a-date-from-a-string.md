## What & Why?
Parsing a date from a string involves extracting date information encoded within strings and converting it into a structured format that programming environments can recognize and manipulate. Programmers do this to enable operations such as date comparison, arithmetic, formatting, and localization, which are essential for handling scheduling, timestamps, and historical data efficiently in software.

## How to:
In Fish Shell, you don't have built-in commands specifically designed for parsing dates from strings. Instead, you rely on external utilities like `date` (available in Linux and macOS) or leverage popular third-party tools such as `GNU date` for more complex parsing. Here's how to approach it:

**Using `date` with Fish:**

To parse a date string in the format "YYYY-MM-DD", you can use the `date` command with the `-d` (or `--date` for GNU date) option followed by the string. The `+` option is used to format the output.

```fish
set date_str "2023-04-01"
date -d $date_str +"%A, %d %B %Y"
# Output: Saturday, 01 April 2023
```

For macOS (which requires a different format for the `-j` and `-f` flags):

```fish
set date_str "2023-04-01"
date -j -f "%Y-%m-%d" $date_str +"%A, %d %B %Y"
# Output: Saturday, 01 April 2023
```

**Using GNU `date` for complex parsing:** 

GNU `date` is more flexible with string formats. It can auto-detect many common date string formats without explicitly specifying the input format:

```fish
set complex_date_str "April 1, 2023 14:00"
date -d "$complex_date_str" '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'
# Output: 2023-04-01 14:00:00
```

However, when working with date strings that may not be automatically recognized or when precise control over the input format is needed, specifying the input format with GNU `date` isn't directly supported. In such cases, consider preprocessing the string or using another tool designed for more complex date parsing routines.
