## What & Why?

Interpolating a string means blending variables or expressions within a string. It saves time and enhances readability by allowing dynamic content without string concatenation gymnastics.

## How to:

In Fish, you use double quotes and place the variable or command you want to interpolate with a dollar sign `$` straight in the string.

```fish
set name "world"
echo "Hello, $name!"
```

Output:
```
Hello, world!
```

To include the output of a command within a string:

```fish
echo "I have (count (ls)) files in this directory."
```

Output might be:
```
I have 9 files in this directory.
```

Variables and commands get evaluated and neatly tucked into the place you put them.

## Deep Dive

Before Fish and other modern shells, you'd often use a more clunky combo of quotes and concatenation—or rely on external tools—to get variables into strings.

In bash, for example, it'd look like this:

```bash
name="world"
echo "Hello, "$name"!"
```

Not as slick, right?

Fish not only streamlines this process but also handles errors more gracefully. If a variable doesn't exist, Fish will insert an empty string, lessening the chance of a crash from mishandled interpolations.

Alternatives to direct interpolation include using the `printf` command:

```fish
set animal "narwhal"
printf "The %s is an awesome creature!" $animal
```

Output:
```
The narwhal is an awesome creature!
```

In this case, `%s` is a placeholder for the string variable `$animal` that gets replaced by `printf`.

In terms of implementation, when Fish processes the command line, it parses the double-quoted strings and swaps the variables with their values on the fly. It's elegant and mimics the variable interpolation found in higher-level languages like Ruby or PHP.
