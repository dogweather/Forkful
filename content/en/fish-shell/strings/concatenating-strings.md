## What & Why?
Concatenating strings means sticking them together end-to-end. Programmers do it to combine text, like building a full sentence from words or creating file paths.

## How to:
In Fish, slap strings together with spaces between or use `string join`.

```fish
# Combine 'Hello' and 'World!' with a space
echo 'Hello' 'World!'

# Output: Hello World!

# Concatenate variables
set greet "Howdy"
set who "Partner"
echo $greet $who

# Output: Howdy Partner

# No-spaces concatenation with string join
set file "report"
set ext "txt"
string join '' $file '.' $ext

# Output: report.txt
```

## Deep Dive
Concatenation's been around since the dawn of programming. In Fish, `string join` is cleaner than older methods, such as using `echo` followed by string vars without quotes. This approach avoids subcommand overhead, which can be a performance win.

Alternatives include the use of `printf`, which gives more formatting control but is a touch more complex for simple joining operations. Example:

```fish
set firstName "Ada"
set lastName "Lovelace"
printf "%s %s\n" $firstName $lastName
```

Fish's `string` command is part of a built-in string manipulation toolbox introduced to make text processing more straightforward. Itâ€™s not unique to Fish, but its inclusion as a built-in tool keeps things simple.
