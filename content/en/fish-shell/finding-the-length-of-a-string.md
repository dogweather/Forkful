## What & Why?
Finding the length of a string means counting the number of characters in it. Programmers do it to validate input, size buffers, or loop through characters.

## How to:
Here's how to get a string's length in Fish:

```Fish Shell
set my_string "Hello, World!"
echo (string length "$my_string")
```

Output:

```
13
```

## Deep Dive
In Fish, unlike some other shells, `string length` is a built-in function making it native and efficient. Historically, other shells might have required more verbose syntax or external tools like `expr` or `wc`. Fish simplifies tasks with its robust string handling functions, where `string length` directly gives the count of Unicode characters, which isn't always equal to the byte count, especially for non-ASCII characters.

Alternatives for string length determination in shells before the `string` function in Fish could be less reliable because they didn't always account for multibyte characters. Implementation wise, `string length` counts Unicode graphemes, which is important for texts containing characters that combine with others to form a single visual unit.
