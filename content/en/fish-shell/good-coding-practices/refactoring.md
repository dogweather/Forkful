## What & Why?
Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing code without changing its external behavior to improve nonfunctional attributes. Programmers do it to make code more readable, reduce complexity, improve maintainability, and make it easier to scale or modify down the road.

## How to:
Imagine you've got a script that's grown quite a bit over time. It started simple, but now it's a beast sprawling with tentacles of logic. Here's a bite-sized example of refactoring a function to be more legible and efficient:

Before refactoring:
```fish
function old_and_clunky
    set color (cat ~/.config/fish/color_theme)
    if test "$color" = 'blue'
        echo 'Blue theme set!'
    else if test "$color" = 'red'
        echo 'Red theme set!'
    else
        echo 'Default theme set!'
    end
end
```

After refactoring:
```fish
function set_theme_color
    set theme_color (cat ~/.config/fish/color_theme)
    switch $theme_color
        case blue
            echo 'Blue theme set!'
        case red
            echo 'Red theme set!'
        default
            echo 'Default theme set!'
    end
end
```
Refactoring improved the function’s name to better describe its purpose and replaced the if-else chain with a cleaner `switch` statement.

Sample output:
```
Blue theme set!
```

## Deep Dive
Refactoring was first described in detail in Martin Fowler's seminal book "Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code". The book laid out a structured approach to improving code without writing new functionality. Many refactoring techniques have been introduced since then, and the concept has become a fundamental part of modern software development.

In the Fish Shell environment, refactoring might look slightly different than in other programming contexts due to its specialized syntax and command-line nature. Alternatives to refactoring scripts in Fish could involve porting to another shell language or using external tools for more advanced script management. However, keeping the native Fish syntax often means better integration with the shell’s features and a more streamlined experience overall.

When refactoring in Fish Shell, you’re mostly dealing with functions and commands as opposed to wide-scope classes or modules common in other languages. This granularity can make the task of refactoring a more immediate and direct process, but it also emphasizes the importance of clear, concise, and maintainable code.
