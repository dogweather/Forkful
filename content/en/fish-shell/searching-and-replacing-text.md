## What & Why?
Searching and replacing text is finding specific strings and swapping them with something else. Programmers do it to update code, correct errors, or to reformat data — it's a huge timesaver.

## How to:
Let's change all instances of 'cat' to 'dog' in a string.

```Fish Shell
echo "One cat, two cats, three cats." | string replace -a 'cat' 'dog'
```
Sample output:
```
One dog, two dogs, three dogs.
```
Replacing text in a file named `pets.txt`:

```Fish Shell
string replace -a 'cat' 'dog' < pets.txt > updated_pets.txt
```

Using variables for patterns:

```Fish Shell
set old "cat"
set new "dog"
string replace -a $old $new < pets.txt > updated_pets.txt
```

## Deep Dive
Search and replace has been in text editors since the early days. Think `sed` for stream editing in Unix — that’s old school cool. Fish takes this further, making it simpler with the `string` command. No more regex headaches unless you want them. Alternatives? Sure: `sed`, `awk`, Perl scripts, even `vim` macros. But Fish’s `string` command is elegant and less prone to errors for the common cases.
