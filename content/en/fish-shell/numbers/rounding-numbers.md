## How to:
In Fish, rounding numbers hinges on the `math` command. Use `math -s0` to round to the nearest integer.

```fish
# Round up
echo (math -s0 "4.7")
# Output: 5

# Round down
echo (math -s0 "4.3")
# Output: 4

# Round to two decimal places
echo (math -s2 "4.5678")
# Output: 4.57

# Round negative number
echo (math -s0 "-2.5")
# Output: -3
```

## Deep Dive
Historically, rounding numbers was done more manually or with external tools, but in modern shells like Fish, it's baked into built-in utilities. Fish's approach using the `math` command simplifies things compared to older shells. Alternatives in other programming environments vary; languages like Python use functions like `round()`, while Bash might require more complex expressions or `bc` utility. Fish's rounding implementation simplifies scripting by keeping the math inside the shell environment instead of invoking other tools or languages.
