## What & Why?

Reading a text file is retrieving and interpreting the data stored in a file as text. Programmers do this to access and use data saved in files, which is crucial in data-driven applications.

## How to:

Swift provides easy ways to read a text file. Let's suppose we have a text file named `DataSource.txt`:

```Swift
// Specify the file path
let filePath = "/path/to/your/DataSource.txt"

// Use the String initializer to read the file
do {
    let fileContents = try String(contentsOfFile: filePath, encoding: .utf8)
    print(fileContents)
} catch {
    print("Could not read the file")
}
```

The output will be the contents of your `DataSource.txt` file.
 
## Deep Dive:

Reading text files has been a fundamental task since the beginning of programming. It allows programmers to store massive amounts of data separately from the programmed procedures. It also helps in providing dynamic data inputs without modification of code.

Alternative methods include using `FileManager` or the `Data` object, but using the `String` initializer is the most straightforward way. This is because in both alternatives, you're dealing with byte data instead of text, requiring conversion.

When Swift reads a text file, it does so line by line. Each line is a string. If the file is large, this operation could be memory-heavy. Swift doesn't read the entire file into memory at once, but if the file is too large, it still may consume significant memory.
