## How to:
Swift makes reading command line arguments super straightforward. They're accessible through the `CommandLine` structure. Here's the gist:

```swift
for argument in CommandLine.arguments {
    print(argument)
}
```

If you throw this into a `main.swift` file and run your program with some extra text, like `swift run YourProgram foo bar`, your output will look like this:

```
/path/to/YourProgram
foo
bar
```

That's each argument printed out, including the path to your program as the first element – always keep that in mind!

## Deep Dive
Historically, command line arguments have been a staple in programming, letting folks tailor a program's behavior without changing code. It's Unix's legacy, and pretty much all languages support this feature.

In Swift, `CommandLine.arguments` is an array of strings, with each element being a slice of your input, split by whitespace. This array is handed off by the operating system when your program starts; Swift just makes it easy to access.

Besides `CommandLine.arguments`, you could dive into more complex parsing with libraries like `Swift Argument Parser` for more heavy lifting. This is handy for when you need more than just simple inputs – think flags, options, and sub-commands.

Implementation-wise, those command line arguments get to you through a C array behind the scenes – good old `argc` and `argv`. Swift keeps it hidden but still retains the same basic behavior you'd find in C or C++.
