## How to:
To read text from a file in Swift, use `String` class' convenience methods. Here's a bite-sized example:

```Swift
import Foundation

if let filePath = Bundle.main.path(forResource: "example", ofType: "txt") {
    do {
        let content = try String(contentsOfFile: filePath, encoding: .utf8)
        print(content)
    } catch {
        print("Oops! Something went wrong: \(error)")
    }
}
```
If "example.txt" contains "Hello, world!", the output is:
```
Hello, world!
```

## Deep Dive
Reading text files is as old as hills in the programming world. Early on, it was all about punch cards and tape. Now, with high-level languages like Swift, it's straightforward. The snippet above uses `String(contentsOfFile:)`, but there are alternatives:

- `FileManager`: Good for more complex file operations.
- `InputStream`: Use it when dealing with large filesâ€”less memory-intensive.
- `URLSession`: Fetch files from a remote server.

The `String(contentsOfFile:)` approach can be memory-heavy if used with mega-sized files. To prevent issues, consider stream-based methods or chunked reading.
