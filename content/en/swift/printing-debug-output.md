# Debugging Magic in Swift: An Introduction to Print Debugging

## What & Why?
"Print" debugging is the act of outputting variable states and program flow info to the console. It's like a debugging GPS that helps locate and fix bugs, offering real-time insights without breakpoints.

## How to?

Straight to the action, let's write out the classic greeting to the world:

```Swift
print("Hello, World!")
```

The output? Expect to see:

```
Hello, World!
```

Fantastic? Let's kick it up a notch. Printed output can include variable values:

```Swift
let greeting = "Howdy, Mars!"
print(greeting)
```

You'll shake hands with:

```
Howdy, Mars!
```

Want something more advanced? Go for string interpolation:

```Swift
let planet = "Mars"
print("Howdy, \(planet)!")
```

This will yield:

```
Howdy, Mars!
```

## Deep Dive

Back in the day, print debugging has been THE strategy, especially when transparent debuggers weren't commonplace yet. 

Consider "print()" equivalents. Say "debugPrint()" for complex data types:

```Swift
let alien = ["name": "Marvin", "planet": "Mars"]
debugPrint(alien)
```

This will unmask:

```
["name": "Marvin", "planet": "Mars"]
```

We also have the "dump()" function, which provides a more detailed, hierarchy view of objects:

```Swift
let spaceship = ["type": "UFO", "capacity": 3]
dump(spaceship)
```

and behold:

```
â–¿ 2 elements
  - key: "type"
  - value: "UFO"
  - key: "capacity"
  - value: 3
```

These are integral for debugging complex structures. But remember, scrub prints before shipping your code. You wouldn't want your secret debug comments exposed, would you?
