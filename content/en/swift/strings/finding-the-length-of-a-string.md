## What & Why?
Finding the length of a string means figuring out how many characters it contains. Programmers do this to validate input, manipulate text, or simply to understand the size of their data.

## How to:
In Swift, you get a string's length by accessing its `count` property. Straightforward, let's do it:

```Swift
let greeting = "Hello, World!"
print(greeting.count) // Output: 13
```

Remember that Swift considers emoji as single characters, thanks to Unicode:

```Swift
let wave = "ðŸ‘‹"
print(wave.count)  // Output: 1
```

## Deep Dive
Back in the Objective-C days, string length wasn't so directâ€”there was `length` and `lengthOfBytes(using:)`. Swift made it cleaner with `count`.

Be aware of composite characters: visually single characters made of multiple Unicode scalars. `count` handles these gracefully.

Alternatives? Sure, you could traverse the string with a loop, but that's re-inventing the wheel and less efficient.

Under the hood, `count` is O(n), where â€˜nâ€™ is the number of characters. Thatâ€™s because Swiftâ€™s `String` is not a collection of `Char`s, but a sequence of grapheme clusters, which can vary in length.
