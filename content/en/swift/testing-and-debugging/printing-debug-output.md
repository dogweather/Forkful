## What & Why?

In Swift, printing debug output means displaying data in a debug area, typically within an IDE or a console, for monitoring what's happening live in your code. It's the go-to move for quickly diagnosing issues or understanding code flow—think of it as a sneak peek into your code's brain.

## How to:

In Swift, you've got a friend in the `print()` function. Easy to use, it gives you eyes on what's going down in your code.

```Swift
var greeting = "Hello, playground"
print(greeting)
// Output: Hello, playground

let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for number in numbers {
    print(number)
}
// Output:
// 1
// 2
// 3
// 4
// 5
```

But wait, there's more! Need detailed debug info? `debugPrint()` has you covered:

```Swift
debugPrint(greeting)
// Output: "Hello, playground"
```

Notice those quotes? `debugPrint()` spills the beans with extra details about data types and structure.

## Deep Dive

In the old days of Objective-C, we used `NSLog` to log stuff out. Swift kept things simple—`print()` is your bread and butter for standard output, while `debugPrint()` is the flavored butter for detailed views.

Interesting fact: Standard output in Swift isn't just text—it can be any type that conforms to `CustomStringConvertible` or `CustomDebugStringConvertible`. These protocols let you customize how your objects look when they tell their tales through printing.

Under the hood, `print()` and `debugPrint()` use `String(describing:)` and `String(reflecting:)` to turn your objects into strings. Basically, these functions use a mirror to take a selfie of your data.

Alternatives? You've got `os_log` and `NSLog`, but these are more suited for production-level logging, not the quick-and-dirty debugging we're jamming on here.
