## How to:
Swift supports testing through its XCTest framework, which is integrated into Xcode. You can write unit tests to verify individual parts of your code, for example, a function that calculates the sum of two numbers.

```swift
import XCTest
@testable import YourApp

class YourAppTests: XCTestCase {

    func testSum() {
        let result = Calculator().sum(a: 1, b: 2)
        XCTAssertEqual(result, 3, "The sum function did not return the expected value.")
    }
}
```

To run this test, you'd typically press Command-U in Xcode. The output in the Xcode test navigator will tell you if the test passed or failed. 

For example, a successful test output:
```
Test Case '-[YourAppTests testSum]' passed (0.005 seconds).
```

For more advanced testing scenarios, you might adopt third-party libraries such as Quick/Nimble, which offer a more expressive syntax for writing tests.

With Quick/Nimble, you might write the same test like this:

```swift
// Add Quick and Nimble to your Swift package manager or use CocoaPods/Carthage to install them
import Quick
import Nimble
@testable import YourApp

class CalculatorSpec: QuickSpec {
    override func spec() {
        describe("Calculator") {
            context("when summing numbers") {
                it("should return the correct sum") {
                    let calculator = Calculator()
                    expect(calculator.sum(a: 1, b: 2)).to(equal(3))
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Running this test would give you similar output in your test console or CI/CD tool's log, indicating whether the test succeeded or failed, with a more readable format for describing tests and expectations.
