## What & Why?

Working with CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files involves parsing and generating structured data from text files where each line represents a record and each record consists of fields separated by commas. Programmers often engage in this activity to easily import, export, and manipulate tabular data using a format that is widely supported across different platforms and programming languages, due to its simplicity and human-readable format.

## How to:

In Swift, there isn't native support for parsing CSV files directly, but you can handle CSV data by using the `String` methods to split the contents, or by leveraging third-party libraries such as SwiftCSV for a more streamlined approach. Here are both methods:

### Manual Parsing without External Libraries
```swift
// Consider a simple CSV string
let csvString = """
name,age,city
John Doe,29,New York
Jane Smith,34,Los Angeles
"""

// Split the CSV string into lines
let rows = csvString.components(separatedBy: "\n")

// Extract the keys from the first row
let keys = rows.first?.components(separatedBy: ",")

// Iterate over the rows starting from the second one
var result: [[String: String]] = []
for row in rows.dropFirst() {
    let values = row.components(separatedBy: ",")
    let dict = Dictionary(uniqueKeysWithValues: zip(keys!, values))
    result.append(dict)
}

// Sample Output
print(result)
// Outputs: [{"city": "New York", "age": "29", "name": "John Doe"}, {"city": "Los Angeles", "age": "34", "name": "Jane Smith"}]
```
This approach is straightforward but lacks robustness, especially with CSV files containing special cases like commas in values, line breaks within fields, etc.

### Using SwiftCSV Library
First, add SwiftCSV to your project by including it in your `Package.swift` dependencies:
```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/swiftcsv/SwiftCSV.git", from: "0.5.6")
```
Then, import and use it as follows:
```swift
import SwiftCSV

// Assume `csvString` is defined as above

// Create a CSV object
if let csv = try? CSV(string: csvString) {
    // Access rows as dictionaries
    let rows = csv.namedRows
    
    // Sample Output
    print(rows)
    // Outputs: [{"city": "New York", "age": "29", "name": "John Doe"}, {"city": "Los Angeles", "age": "34", "name": "Jane Smith"}]
}
```
SwiftCSV simplifies parsing by automatically dealing with nuances like encapsulated commas, line breaks in fields, and character encoding. However, remember to handle possible errors in real-world applications, especially when dealing with external data sources.
