## What & Why?

Converting a string to lowercase means swapping any uppercase letters to their lowercase counterparts. Programmers do this for consistency, often for case-insensitive comparisons or standardizing text input.

## How to:

Swift makes this easy with a property called `lowercased`. Here's how you use it:

```Swift
let originalString = "Hello, World!"
let lowercasedString = originalString.lowercased()
print(lowercasedString) // "hello, world!"
```

Sample output:
```
hello, world!
```

## Deep Dive:

Historically, ensuring consistent string case has been crucial in programming, mainly since early computers were very case-sensitive. In Swift, `lowercased()` is a method available on instances of the `String` type. By invoking it, you convert all characters within the string that have lowercased variants to their lowercased forms.

Alternatives to `lowercased()` could be manually traversing the string and replacing each character with its lowercased equivalent by using a mapping function. But, honestly, that's reinventing the wheel.

String lowercasing has some nuances. For instance, the `lowercased()` method uses the current locale to handle specific language casing rules, which is not always the desired behavior. If you need to perform locale-independent conversions, you can resort to `lowercased(with: Locale?)` and pass `nil` as the Locale:

```Swift
let turkishString = "İstanbul"
let lowercasedTurkishString = turkishString.lowercased(with: nil)
print(lowercasedTurkishString) // "i̇stanbul", correct in Unicode, but 'I' without dot might be expected in Turkey.
```

The implementation of `lowercased()` under the hood leverages the Unicode standard which includes complex mapping rules for characters in various scripts, not all of which are a simple matter of 'a' replacing 'A'.
