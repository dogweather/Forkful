## What & Why?

Converting a date into a string in Swift is transforming the date's binary form into human-readable text. Programmers do this to display dates in a user-friendly format or to smoothly transfer data between systems that use different date formats.

## How to:

Let's get straight into it. Swift offers a handy `DateFormatter` class. 

Here's a quick example:

```Swift
import Foundation

let currentDate = Date()
let formatter = DateFormatter()

formatter.dateStyle = .full

let dateString = formatter.string(from: currentDate)

print(dateString)
```

Running this will give you something like:

`"Tuesday, March 15, 2022"`

This example turns the current date into a full-format string. You can change the style (`.full` part) to `.short`, `.medium`, or `.long` to customise your output.

## Deep Dive

Date to string conversion isn't unique to Swift; it's a common task in many programming languages. Originally, computers stored dates as binary numbers. But to humans, binary numbers are undecipherable gobbledygookâ€”problematic when we needed to view or store dates in text files. Converting dates to strings solved this issue.

Thankfully, Swift's `DateFormatter` offers various formatting styles (.short, .medium, .long, .full) as we saw before. You can even use custom formats with the help of `dateFormat` property:

```Swift
formatter.dateFormat = "E, d MMM yyyy HH:mm:ss Z"
```

This gives us more freedom to design how we want our date represented (like `"Tue, 15 Mar 2022 11:41:50 +0000"`).

A word of caution though: Converting dates to strings will cost you some performance. Swift has to process your date and output a string, which is slower than spitting out a raw binary number. So if you're dealing with thousands or millions of dates and performance is critical, you might need to rethink your strategy.
