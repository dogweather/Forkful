## How to:
Swift makes it straightforward to send HTTP requests using the `URLSession` class. Here's a simple GET request example:

```Swift
import Foundation

// URL of the resource you're requesting
if let url = URL(string: "https://api.example.com/data") {

    // Create a URLSessionDataTask
    let task = URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: url) { data, response, error in
        
        // Check if there's an error
        if let error = error {
            print("Error fetching data: \(error)")
            return
        }
        
        // Check if we got a valid response and data
        if let httpResponse = response as? HTTPURLResponse, 
           httpResponse.statusCode == 200,
           let data = data {
            
            // Convert data to string and print
            let dataString = String(decoding: data, as: UTF8.self)
            print(dataString)
        }
    }
    // Start the task
    task.resume()
}

// Sample output would be the content fetched from the API.
```

To send a POST request with JSON:

```Swift
import Foundation
import CoreFoundation

// Your API endpoint
if let url = URL(string: "https://api.example.com/submit") {

    // Prepare the data you want to send
    let dictionary = ["key": "value"]
    guard let jsonData = try? JSONSerialization.data(withJSONObject: dictionary) else {
        print("Error: Cannot create JSON from dictionary")
        return
    }
    
    // Prepare URLRequest
    var request = URLRequest(url: url)
    request.httpMethod = "POST"
    request.setValue("application/json", forHTTPHeaderField: "Content-Type")
    request.httpBody = jsonData
    
    // Create and start the task
    let task = URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: request) { data, response, error in
        // Handle response here
    }
    task.resume()
}

// Output depends on the response from the server. No standard output.
```

## Deep Dive:
HTTP requests are the bread and butter of web communication. They've been around since the early days of the web, allowing for a standardized way of exchanging data. 

Alternatives to `URLSession` include third-party libraries like Alamofire that simplify syntax and add functionality. However, `URLSession` remains the native go-to for network calls, and Apple keeps it up-to-date with the latest networking features and security standards.

An implementation detail to note is that network requests are asynchronous by nature in Swift. They run in the background, allowing the app to stay responsive. When a response comes back, a completion handler is called. It's crucial to handle thread management properly, especially when updating the UI, which must happen on the main thread.
