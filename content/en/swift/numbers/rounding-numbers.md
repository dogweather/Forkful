## How to:
Swift provides several ways to round numbers. Here's a taste:

```Swift
let original = 3.14159

// Standard rounding
let standardRounded = round(original) // 3.0

// Rounding to specific decimal place
let decimalRounded = Double(round(original * 1000) / 1000) // 3.142

// Rounding down
let roundedDown = floor(original) // 3.0

// Rounding up
let roundedUp = ceil(original) // 4.0

print("Standard: \(standardRounded), Decimal: \(decimalRounded), Down: \(roundedDown), Up: \(roundedUp)")
```

Output: `Standard: 3.0, Decimal: 3.142, Down: 3.0, Up: 4.0`

## Deep Dive
Historically, rounding is a mathematical concept predating computers, essential in commerce and science. Swift's `Foundation` framework offers comprehensive rounding functionality:

- `round(_: )` is good old half-up rounding.
- `floor(_: )` and `ceil(_: )` handle directional rounding.
- `rounded(.up/.down/.toNearestOrAwayFromZero)` gives finer control with rounding rules enum.

Be aware of the `Decimal` type for precise financial calculations, which avoids floating-point errors. Also, explore `NSDecimalNumber` for Objective-C compatibility.
