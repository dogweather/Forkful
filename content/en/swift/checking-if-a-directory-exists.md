## What & Why?
Checking if a directory exists in the filesystem is essential for managing file structures from within your Swift applications. This task enables developers to verify the presence of directories before attempting to read from or write to them, thus avoiding possible runtime errors.

## How to:

Swift's Foundation framework provides the `FileManager` class, which has methods to manage the file system. You can use `FileManager` to check if a directory exists. Here's a snippet on how to do this:

```swift
import Foundation

let fileManager = FileManager.default
let path = "/path/to/your/directory"

if fileManager.fileExists(atPath: path, isDirectory: nil) {
    print("Directory exists")
} else {
    print("Directory does not exist")
}
```

However, this checks for both files and directories. If you specifically want to verify a directory exists, you need to pass a pointer to a Boolean value in `isDirectory`:

```swift
import Foundation

let fileManager = FileManager.default
let path = "/path/to/your/directory"
var isDirectory: ObjCBool = false

if fileManager.fileExists(atPath: path, isDirectory: &isDirectory), isDirectory.boolValue {
    print("Directory exists")
} else {
    print("Directory does not exist")
}
```

### Using a Third-Party Library

As of now, checking for the existence of a directory in Swift usually doesn’t necessitate third-party libraries due to the robustness of the `FileManager` class. However, for more complex file manipulation and checking, libraries like **Files** by John Sundell provide a more Swift-friendly API.

Here’s how you might use it:

First, add Files to your project via Swift Package Manager.

Then, you can check for a directory's existence like so:

```swift
import Files

do {
    _ = try Folder(path: "/path/to/your/directory")
    print("Directory exists")
} catch {
    print("Directory does not exist")
}
```

Note: As third-party libraries can change, always refer to the latest documentation for usage and best practices.
