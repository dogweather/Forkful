## What & Why?
Using a debugger means tapping into specialized tools to test and inspect your code as it runs. It's a big deal because it lets you see what's going on under the hood, find bugs, and understand your code's behavior better.

## How to:
To use the debugger in Xcode (the IDE for Swift), you can set breakpoints, inspect variables, and watch expressions. Here's an example:

```Swift
func findFactorial(of number: Int) -> Int {
    if number == 0 {
        return 1
    }
    return number * findFactorial(of: number - 1)
}

let result = findFactorial(of: 5)
print(result)
```

Set a breakpoint by clicking left to a line number in Xcode, and run the program. When it hits the breakpoint, Xcode pauses the execution. Now you can:

1. Check variable values.
2. Step over (run the next line) or step into (go inside a function) using the debugger controls.
3. Add expressions to the 'watch list' to monitor changes to specific variables or constants.

Here's what you might see in the debug area:

```
(lldb) po number
5
(lldb) po result
120
```

## Deep Dive:
Debuggers have been part of the programming landscape since the 1940s, evolving from simple breakpoint systems to complex, UI-driven experiences. Other options besides Xcode's built-in debugger include third-party tools like LLDB (Low Level Debugger) which Xcode uses under the hood. Some folks even debug with `print()` statements (affectionately known as "caveman debugging"), but this is less efficient for large projects or complex bugs. When you use a debugger, you're juggling execution control, runtime introspection, and data manipulation. A deep understanding of these principles goes a long way in efficient debugging.
