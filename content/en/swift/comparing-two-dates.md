## What & Why?
Comparing two dates is like asking, "Which came first, the chicken or the egg?" but with calendar dates. Programmers do it to sort events, trigger actions, and evaluate periods.

## How to:
Swift uses the `Date` type for date and time. Here's a simple take on comparing two dates:

```Swift
import Foundation

let dateFormatter = DateFormatter()
dateFormatter.dateFormat = "yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm"

// Creating two date objects
let date1 = dateFormatter.date(from: "2023/01/01 09:00")!
let date2 = dateFormatter.date(from: "2023/02/01 10:00")!

// Comparing dates
if date1 == date2 {
    print("Dates are the same")
} else if date1 < date2 {
    print("Date1 is earlier than Date2")
} else {
    print("Date1 is later than Date2")
}
```

Sample output:

`Date1 is earlier than Date2`

Comparison operators can be used because `Date` conforms to the `Comparable` protocol.

## Deep Dive:
Dates didn't always come in handy objects. Originally, you had to wrangle individual components like year, month, and day. Much worse. Now, `Date` objects in Swift handle heavy lifting, and comparing them is straightforward with built-in operators.

Before Swift and Cocoa's `Date`, Objective-C used `NSDate`, but they're bridgeable, so old code can still play nice.

And hey, not just `<`, `>`, and `==` — you can also use `timeIntervalSince(_:)` for more granular control, like:

```Swift
let timeInterval = date2.timeIntervalSince(date1)
```

This gives you the difference in seconds. Positive value: date2 is ahead; negative: it's behind; zero: they're identical. Super useful for timers, countdowns, and tracking durations. Under the hood, dates are just reference points in time—think of them as fancy timestamps.
