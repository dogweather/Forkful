## What & Why?

Finding the length of a string refers to determining the number of characters in it. Programmers do it to control text input in UI design, validate user input, or manipulate strings better.

## How to:

In Swift, to find out the length of a string, we simply use the `count` property, like so:

```Swift
let myString = "Hello, Swift!"
print(myString.count)
```

This will output:

`13`

The count includes the characters, spaces, and punctuation marks.

Here’s another example that doesn’t include any spaces or punctuation:

```Swift
let myString = "HelloSwift"
print(myString.count)
```

The output will be:

`10`

## Deep Dive:

While Swift uses the straightforward `count` property via Strings type, this has not been the case throughout the history of programming. Earlier languages like C required a function (`strlen()`) to determine the string length. C++ and Java make use of built-in methods like `.length()`. 

As an alternative, Swift also allows you to use the `utf16.count` or `unicodeScalars.count` based on what length you want to calculate. Differentiating between a Unicode scalar, a character, and a UTF-16 code unit can be important in internationalized scenarios.

The implementation of the string `count` property in Swift is interesting. It doesn't count characters one by one each time you call it. Swift strings are encoded in UTF-8 and might use one to four 8-bit bytes to store each character, but the string also stores the character counts for efficiency.
