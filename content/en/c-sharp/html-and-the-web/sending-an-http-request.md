## How to:
C# makes sending HTTP requests straightforward with `HttpClient`. Here's the skeleton of a GET request:

```C#
using System;
using System.Net.Http;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

class Program
{
    static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        using HttpClient client = new HttpClient();
        HttpResponseMessage response = await client.GetAsync("http://example.com");
        response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
        string responseBody = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
        
        Console.WriteLine(responseBody);
    }
}
```

Sample output (truncated):
```
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Example Domain</title>
...
```

## Deep Dive
`HttpClient` was introduced in .NET Framework 4.5 to make HTTP communication easier. Before that, you'd likely have to wrestle with `HttpWebRequest` and `HttpWebResponse` classes, which were more cumbersome.

There are other ways to send HTTP requests in C#. `RestSharp` and `Flurl` are two popular third-party libraries offering a more fluent interface and extra features. But `HttpClient` is usually more than enough for most needs.

Implementation wise, `HttpClient` is designed to be reused for multiple requests. Instantiating it for each request can exhaust the number of sockets available under heavy loads. Always, and I mean always, pay attention to proper disposal of `HttpClient` instances to avoid resource leaks.
