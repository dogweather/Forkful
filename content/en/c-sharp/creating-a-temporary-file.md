## What & Why?
Creating a temporary file means you're generating a file for a short-term purpose, like storing data that's only needed during the execution of a program. Programmers do this for various reasons, such as avoiding memory constraints or keeping a temporary state during complex operations.

## How to:
Here's a quick way to create and write to a temporary file in C#:

```C#
using System;
using System.IO;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Create a temporary file
        string tempFilePath = Path.GetTempFileName();

        // Write something to the temporary file
        File.WriteAllText(tempFilePath, "Hello, Temp World!");

        // Read back from the temporary file and print
        string fileContents = File.ReadAllText(tempFilePath);
        Console.WriteLine(fileContents);

        // Clean up the temporary file
        File.Delete(tempFilePath);
    }
}
```

Sample output:
```
Hello, Temp World!
```

## Deep Dive
Temporary files have been around since the early days of computing when minimizing memory usage was crucial. They provide a sandboxed environment for programs to work with data without long-term storage consequences.

Besides `Path.GetTempFileName()`, you have other choices like `Path.GetRandomFileName()`, not creating a file but giving you a name to use for a temporary one. Also, the `System.IO.TempFileCollection` class can manage multiple temporary files, handy when you need more than one.

Under the hood, most C# methods for creating temporary files utilize APIs provided by the underlying operating system. In Windows, `GetTempFileName()` maps to a similar Win32 API function that ensures the filename's uniqueness and secures it against collisions.

Remember to always delete temporary files. Even though they're in a temp directory, they can pile up if neglected, becoming a sort of digital hoarding nightmare.
