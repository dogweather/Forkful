## What & Why?
Reading command line arguments allows a C# program to process user inputs given at launch. Programmers use this to customize app behavior without altering code.

## How to:
Here's how to gobble up those command line arguments:

```C#
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("You've entered the following arguments:");
        foreach (string arg in args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(arg);
        }
    }
}
```

If you run your program like this: `yourapp.exe arg1 arg2 arg3`, expect the output:

```
You've entered the following arguments:
arg1
arg2
arg3
```

## Deep Dive
The tradition of command line arguments harks back to the dawn of computing, allowing early software to be flexible. In C#, `args` is a string array in `Main()` holding the arguments passed. Alternatives? Sure, there are libraries such as `CommandLineParser` that beef up capabilities, but for many tasks, `args` is your quick and dirty friend.

Under the hood, a C# app starts with `Main()`. When you call your app from a command line or script, the operating system slaps the arguments into an array and passes it to `Main()`. Easy peasy.

Got a complex app? Maybe you need to parse flags, options and values? That's where libs shine with more control and less boilerplate code than raw `args` parsing. But for simple input? `args` all the way.
