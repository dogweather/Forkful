## What & Why?

String interpolation is a convenient way to format and insert expressions into strings in C#. It increases readability and makes it easier to manage complex string layouts.

## How to:

Here's how to interpolate a string in C#:

```C#
string name = "John";
int age = 23;
string result = $"Hello, my name is {name} and I am {age} years old.";
Console.WriteLine(result);
```
And the output will be:
```
Hello, my name is John and I am 23 years old.
```

It's as simple as prefixing a string with a $ and including your variables or expressions in curly braces `{}` within that string.

## Deep Dive

Historically, string formatting in C# has been done via `String.Format` method or using concatenation. The introduction of string interpolation in C# 6 was a game-changer.

```C#
// The old way
string result = string.Format("Hello, my name is {0} and I am {1} years old.", name, age);
```

Although `String.Format` and concatenation are still valid methods, string interpolation offers more readability and less complexity, especially with complex strings and expressions.

Do note that underneath, every interpolated string is transformed into a `String.Format` by the compiler. Therefore, the performance difference is negligible.
