## What & Why?

Calculating a future or past date involves figuring out what the date was, or will be, after or before a specific time interval. Programmers often need this to schedule events, handle expiration dates, or record time-sensitive data.

## How to:

Calculating future dates: 

```C#
using System;

class DateExample
{
    static void Main()
    {
        DateTime currentDate = DateTime.Now;
        TimeSpan oneWeek = TimeSpan.FromDays(7);
        
        DateTime nextWeek = currentDate + oneWeek;
        Console.WriteLine($"One week from now: {nextWeek}");
    }
}
```

Output:

```
One week from now: <date a week from the current date>
```

Calculating past dates:

```C#
using System;

class DateExample
{
    static void Main()
    {
        DateTime currentDate = DateTime.Now;
        TimeSpan tenDaysAgo = TimeSpan.FromDays(-10);
        
        DateTime pastDate = currentDate + tenDaysAgo;
        Console.WriteLine($"Ten days ago was: {pastDate}");
    }
}
```

Output:

```
Ten days ago was: <date ten days before the current date>
```

## Deep Dive

In C#, `DateTime` and `TimeSpan` are the bread and butter for date and time operations. `DateTime` represents an instant in time, typically expressed as a date and time of day. `TimeSpan` represents a time interval.

Historically, date and time calculations were prone to errors due to manual handling of days, months, and leap years. `DateTime` abstracts these complexities, letting the framework handle the tricky bits.

Alternatives to `DateTime` and `TimeSpan` in .NET include `DateTimeOffset`, which includes a time zone offset, making it better for applications that work across time zones. Another alternative is Noda Time, a library by Jon Skeet designed for more complex date and time handling, like differing calendars.

Implementation-wise, when you add a `TimeSpan` to a `DateTime`, under the hood, it's manipulating ticks, the fundamental unit of time in .NET (`1 tick = 100 nanoseconds`). For past dates, a negative `TimeSpan` does the trick.
