# Finding the Length of a String in C#

## What & Why?

Finding the length of a string involves counting the number of characters it contains. Programmers use this common task to validate input, manage text data, and control program flow through conditions.

## How to:

Finding the string length in C# is straightforward, thanks to the built-in `Length` property of the `string` class.

```C#
string example = "Hello World!";
int length = example.Length;
Console.WriteLine(length); 
```

This will output:

```C#
12
```
That's it. Simple and straight to the point.

## Deep Dive

Originally, string lengths were counted manually using loops. With the introduction of high-level languages like C#, such tasks got simplified through built-in properties and methods.

As an alternative to using `Length`, you can use the LINQ `Count()` extension method:

```C#
string example = "Hello World!";
int length = example.Count();
Console.WriteLine(length);
```

Please note, `Length` property is faster and more efficient as it merely returns a precomputed integer value, while `Count()` enumerates the string every time it's called.

Under the hood, the `Length` property of a string in C# returns the value of a private field within the `System.String` class. Also, it is important to consider Unicode characters, represented as two `char` values in C#, while measuring string length.
