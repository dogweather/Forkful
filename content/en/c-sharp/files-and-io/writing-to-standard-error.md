summary: Writing to standard error (stderr) in C# involves directing error messages
  and diagnostics separately from regular output (stdout) to help users and developers
  distinguish between normal program output and error notifications.

## How to:
In C#, writing to standard error can be achieved using the `Console.Error` stream. This stream is used specifically for error messages and diagnostics. Here's a basic example:

```csharp
Console.Error.WriteLine("Error: Failed to process the request.");
```

Sample output (to stderr):
```
Error: Failed to process the request.
```

For scenarios where you might be using a third-party library that offers advanced logging capabilities, like `Serilog` or `NLog`, you can configure these libraries to write error logs to stderr. While these examples focus on simple console redirection, remember that in production applications, logging frameworks offer much more robust error handling and output options. Here's a simple example with `Serilog`:

First, install the Serilog package and its Console sink:

```
Install-Package Serilog
Install-Package Serilog.Sinks.Console
```

Then, configure Serilog to write to stderr:

```csharp
using Serilog;

Log.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration()
    .WriteTo.Console(standardErrorFromLevel: Serilog.Events.LogEventLevel.Error)
    .CreateLogger();

Log.Information("This is a normal message.");
Log.Error("This is an error message.");
```

Sample output (to stderr for the error message):
```
[15:04:20 ERR] This is an error message.
```

Note: The `standardErrorFromLevel` configuration in Serilog's console sink redirects all log events at the specified level (Error, in this case) or higher to the standard error stream, while lower-level messages like Information are written to the standard output stream.
