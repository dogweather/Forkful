## What & Why?
Comparing two dates lets you figure out which one's earlier, later, or if they're the same moment in time. Programmers do this to sort events, trigger timed actions, or just track time passed.

## How to:
Here’s a quick way to compare two dates in Bash:

```Bash
date1="2023-04-01"
date2="2023-04-15"

# Convert dates to seconds since the epoch
sec1=$(date -d "$date1" +%s)
sec2=$(date -d "$date2" +%s)

# Compare the dates
if [ $sec1 -eq $sec2 ]; then
    echo "Dates are the same."
elif [ $sec1 -lt $sec2 ]; then
    echo "Date $date1 is earlier than $date2."
else
    echo "Date $date1 is later than $date2."
fi
```

Sample output if `$date2` is later:

```
Date 2023-04-01 is earlier than 2023-04-15.
```

## Deep Dive
Historically, comparing dates in shell scripts wasn't straightforward due to different date formats and lack of built-in functions. The `date` command, with `%s` to convert dates to seconds since the Unix epoch (00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970), is a godsend.

Alternatives include using external tools like `awk` or doing string comparison – risky if formats vary. Implementation-wise, one quirk is dealing with time zones: adding `TZ=UTC` before `date` commands ensures UTC comparisons.

Date arithmetic, such as finding the difference between dates, can get complex. Adding or subtracting days requires more `date` trickery. Corner cases, like leap seconds or daylight saving transitions, can introduce errors.
