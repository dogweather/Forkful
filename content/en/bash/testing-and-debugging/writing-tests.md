## What & Why?
Writing tests in Bash involves scripting test cases to validate the functionality of your Bash scripts. Programmers conduct tests to ensure their scripts work as expected under various conditions, catching errors and bugs before deployment.

## How to:
Bash doesn’t have a built-in testing framework, but you can write simple test functions. For more sophisticated testing, third-party tools like `bats-core` are popular.

### Basic Test Example in Pure Bash:
```bash
function test_example_function {
  result=$(your_function 'test_input')
  expected_output="expected_output"
  
  if [[ "$result" == "$expected_output" ]]; then
    echo "Test passed."
    return 0
  else
    echo "Test failed. Expected '$expected_output', got '$result'"
    return 1
  fi
}

# Invoking the test function
test_example_function
```
Sample Output:
```
Test passed.
```

### Using `bats-core` for Testing:
First, install `bats-core`. This can usually be done through your package manager or by cloning its repository. 

Then, write your tests in separate `.bats` files.

```bash
# File: example_function.bats

#!/usr/bin/env bats

@test "test example function" {
  result="$(your_function 'test_input')"
  expected_output="expected_output"
  
  [ "$result" == "$expected_output" ]
}
```
To run your tests, simply execute the `.bats` file:
```bash
bats example_function.bats
```
Sample Output:
```
 ✓ test example function

1 test, 0 failures
```

This approach allows you to easily integrate testing into your development workflow, ensuring the reliability and stability of your Bash scripts.
