## What & Why?
Using a debugger in Bash means harnessing tools to test and find issues in your scripts, like trapping bugs that crash your code or sneakily make it misbehave. Programmers do it because it's way smarter to catch errors before they wreak havoc in a live environment.

## How to:
Bash doesn't come with a built-in debugger like some other languages, but you can use built-in commands like `set -x` to trace what's happening. Or, for an upgrade, there's `bashdb`, a proper debugger to step through your code. Here's a peek:

```Bash
# Using set -x to debug
set -x
echo "Start debugging"
my_var="Hello, Debugging World!"
echo $my_var
set +x

# Using bashdb
# Install bashdb with your package manager, e.g., apt, yum, brew.
# Debug a script called my_script.sh:
bashdb my_script.sh
```

Output when running with `set -x`:
```Bash
+ echo 'Start debugging'
Start debugging
+ my_var='Hello, Debugging World!'
+ echo 'Hello, Debugging World!'
Hello, Debugging World!
+ set +x
```

## Deep Dive
Historically, debugging Bash scripts meant littering your code with `echo` statements. But then came `set -x`, giving us a peek into the runtime execution without manual printouts. And for those craving more control, the `bashdb` debugger popped up, inspired by the gdb debugger for C/C++.

As for alternatives, beyond the `set` commands (`-x`, `-v`, `-e`), other options include redirecting output to a file for analysis or using external tools like ShellCheck for static analysis.

Implementation-wise, `set -x` is easy; it's a native Bash option that prints commands and their arguments as they're executed. `bashdb`, on the other hand, allows stepping through code, setting breakpoints, and evaluating expressions - things that give you a fighting chance against more elusive bugs.
