## How to:
Bash doesn't support complex numbers natively. You'll often use an external tool like `bc` with its `-l` option. Here's how you crunch complex numbers in bash:

```bash
echo "sqrt(-1)" | bc -l
```

Output:
```bash
j
```

Multiplication:

```bash
echo "(-1 + -1i) * (4 + 3i)" | bc -l
```

Output:
```bash
-1.00000000000000000000-7.00000000000000000000i
```

## Deep Dive
Complex numbers have been around since the 16th century, but scripting languages like Bash are not primed for mathematical computations like complex numbers out of the box. Thatâ€™s why `bc` or other tools like `awk` often come into play. Some alternative languages for working with complex numbers are Python with its `cmath` module and MATLAB, which are both built for more advanced mathematical functions. As for Bash, it's all about leveraging tools - `bc` uses the lowercase 'i' to represent the imaginary unit and supports basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
