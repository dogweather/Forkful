## What & Why?
Creating a temporary file in Bash means making a file that your scripts can use to store data briefly. Programmers do this to stash bits of info while running complex tasks, avoid cluttering up the hard drive, and to minimize conflicts between different processes trying to use the same file.

## How to:
Bash has a built-in command called `mktemp` to make temporary files easily:

```Bash
# Create a temporary file
temp_file=$(mktemp)

# Check out our fresh temporary file
echo "Temporary file created: $temp_file"

# Use the temporary file
echo "Some data" > "$temp_file"

# Read it back
cat "$temp_file"

# Tidy up: remove the file when you're done
rm "$temp_file"
```
Output:
```
Temporary file created: /tmp/tmp.Iy5nv69sed
Some data
```

## Deep Dive
Temporary files have been in UNIX since the early days, letting users deal with intermediate data without manual cleanup. In Bash scripting, `mktemp` is the modern take, coming with options for creating both files (`mktemp`) and directories (`mktemp -d`). The command makes a unique file every time it's called, which dodges file collision issues that happen when multiple instances of a script or different scripts are running at the same time.

Before `mktemp`, programmers would manually create files with names they hoped would be unique. Clashes were common, leading to data loss and security issues. `mktemp` helps prevent that by ensuring that the filename is unique with a mix of predictable patterns and random characters. Unlike regular files, these temporary ones are meant to be deleted after use, keeping the system tidy.

Some alternatives to `mktemp` include using `/dev/shm` for in-memory temp files, or crafting one with date and process ID (`$$`), but these methods come with more risks of conflicts.
