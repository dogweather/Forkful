title: Reading command line arguments
weight: 23

## How to:
```Bash
#!/bin/bash

# Print the name of the script.
echo "Script name: $0"

# Print the first argument.
echo "First argument: $1"

# Print all arguments.
echo "All arguments: $@"
```

Sample output assuming your script is named 'example.sh' and you call `./example.sh arg1 arg2`:

```
Script name: ./example.sh
First argument: arg1
All arguments: arg1 arg2
```

Loop through arguments:

```Bash
#!/bin/bash

# Loop through each argument.
for arg in "$@"; do
  echo "Argument: $arg"
done
```

## Deep Dive
Bash has supported command line arguments for ages; they are positional parameters, `$0` to `$9`, with `$@` and `$*` showing all. `$0` is the script itself, `$1` to `$9` are the first to ninth argument; braces like `${10}` are needed from tenth on.

Using `$@` is usually better than `$*` as it handles arguments containing spaces correctly. `$@` gives each argument as a separate "word"; `$*` combines them all into a single "word".

You can shift through arguments using the `shift` command, which bumps `$2` to `$1`, and so forth, discarding the old `$1`.

Alternatives? Sure. `getopts` and `getopt` provide more control for options (like -h for help) and flag parsing; check them out if `$1`, `$2`,... don't cut it.
