## How to:
Bash itself lacks built-in JSON parsing capabilities, but `jq` is a powerful command-line JSON processor that fills this gap. Here's how to use it:

**Reading a JSON file:**

Sample `data.json`:
```json
{
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  "email": "jane@example.com",
  "location": {
    "city": "New York",
    "country": "USA"
  }
}
```

To read and extract the name from the JSON file:
```bash
jq '.name' data.json
```
Output:
```
"Jane Doe"
```

**Modifying JSON data:**

To update the city to "Los Angeles" and write back to the file:
```bash
jq '.location.city = "Los Angeles"' data.json > temp.json && mv temp.json data.json
```

**Parsing JSON from a variable:**

If you have JSON in a Bash variable, `jq` can still process it:
```bash
json_string='{"name": "John Doe", "email": "john@example.com"}'
echo $json_string | jq '.name'
```
Output:
```
"John Doe"
```

**Working with arrays:**

Given an array of items in JSON:
```json
{
  "items": ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
}
```

To extract the second item (indexing starts at 0):
```bash
jq '.items[1]' data.json
```
Output:
```
"banana"
```

For more complex operations and filtering, `jq` has a comprehensive manual and tutorials available online, making it a versatile tool for all your Bash/JSON needs.
