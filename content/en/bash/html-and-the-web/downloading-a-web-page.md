## How to:
The go-to tool for this job? `curl`. It's a powerful command-line utility that fetches data from the web. Hereâ€™s the simplest use case:

```Bash
curl https://example.com -o webpage.html
```

This command downloads the HTML of `example.com` and writes it to a file named `webpage.html`. Check out the output:

```Bash
# Sample Output
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100  1256  100  1256    0     0   6458      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--  6497
```

Want to see what you're downloading in real-time? Drop the `-o` and the download prints right in your console:

```Bash
curl https://example.com
```

## Deep Dive
`curl` has been around since 1997, carving its niche for web operations. Why `curl` over browser downloads? Automation and script-friendliness. It's non-interactive and can be woven into bash scripts with ease.

Alternatives worth mentioning: `wget`, another command-line powerhouse that can recursively download web pages. For heavy-duty scraping or when needing a real browser context, programmers turn to tools like Selenium, Puppeteer, or Scrapy.

Getting into `curl`'s workings: It supports multiple protocols, from HTTP and HTTPS to FTP, and a slew of options (--header, --cookie, --user-agent, etc.) for fine-tuning requests. Plus, it usually comes pre-installed on Unix-based systems.
