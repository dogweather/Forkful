# Bash Scripting: String Concatenation

## What & Why?

String concatenation is the process of appending, or 'gluing,' one string to the end of another. This handy trick is used frequently to create custom messages, filenames, or commands.

## How to:

Here's a couple of ways to concatenate strings in Bash.

```Bash
# Method 1: Direct joining
string1="Hello, "
string2="world!"
greeting=$string1$string2
echo $greeting
```

The output will look like this:

```
Hello, world!
```

Or, you can use the "+=" operator for in place concatenation, like so:

```Bash
# Method 2: In-place joining
string1="Hello, "
string1+="world!"
echo $string1
```

The output is:

```
Hello, world!
```

## Deep Dive

Bash, like other UNIX shells, doesn't really have a dedicated concatenation operation. It's all about just gluing strings together, either by using variable expansion or the "+=" operator. 

The "+=" method, added in Bash version 3.1, adds or concatenates right-sided string to the left-sided operand.

Alternatives to Bash include programming languages like Python or Perl. They offer more sophisticated string manipulation functions, but for simplicity and speed â€“ Bash is supreme!
