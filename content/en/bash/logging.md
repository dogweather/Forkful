## What & Why?

Logging is the practice of recording events, errors, and other significant information from the running processes of a program to a file or an output stream. Programmers do it to track the behavior of their applications, debug issues, and maintain a historical record of operations that can assist with future troubleshooting.

## How to:

In Bash, logging can be as simple as redirecting or appending output to a file. Here's a basic example:

```Bash
echo "Starting the script..." >> script.log
# Your script commands here
echo "Script completed on $(date)" >> script.log
```

For something more advanced, you could incorporate syslog for system-wide logging:

```Bash
logger "Custom message from my script"
```

`logger` sends a log message to the syslog service, which then handles it according to the system's syslog configuration.

Sample output captured in `script.log`:

```Bash
Starting the script...
Script completed on Tue Mar 23 09:26:35 PDT 2021
```

## Deep Dive

Historically in Unix-like systems, logging has been facilitated by the syslog service, allowing different applications and parts of the system to log messages centrally. This allows for the implementation of a standardized logging mechanism throughout the system.

When it comes to alternatives, some may look into using `syslog-ng` or `rsyslog` for more advanced logging features, or writing logs to a time-series database for analytical purposes. For applications with higher levels of complexity, using a dedicated logging library or application like Log4j (in the Java ecosystem) or Monolog (in PHP), which can provide structured and configurable logging options, could make sense even for a scripting language like Bash.

The way you implement logging depends greatly on your application's requirements. If you just need simple output to track script progress, appending messages to a file is easy and convenient. However, for more scalable and robust logging, you'll want to integrate with a logging system that supports features like log rotation, log levels, and remote logging.
