## What & Why?

Working with CSV, which stands for "Comma-Separated Values", involves parsing and manipulating data in a tabular text format. Programmers do this because CSV is a common, straightforward file format used for exchanging data between different applications and systems.

## How to:

### Read from a CSV file:

```Bash
while IFS=, read -r col1 col2 col3
do
  echo "Column 1: $col1 | Column 2: $col2 | Column 3: $col3"
done < myfile.csv
```

Sample output:

```
Column 1: data1 | Column 2: data2 | Column 3: data3
```

### Write to a CSV file:

```Bash
echo "data1,data2,data3" > myfile.csv
```

### Append to a CSV file:

```Bash
echo "data4,data5,data6" >> myfile.csv
```

## Deep Dive

CSV format has roots in early computing and has become a mainstay in data interchange because it's supported by a wide range of software. While Bash can handle CSV files, it isnâ€™t equipped for complex parsing. Alternatives for more intricate tasks include AWK, Sed, or using a full programming language like Python. Implementation details to consider when working with CSV in Bash include handling special characters, complex quoting, and line breaks within fields.
