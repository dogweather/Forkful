## What & Why?
REPL stands for Read-Eval-Print Loop, a simple, interactive computer programming environment. Coders use it to quickly write and test code, experiment with syntax, and learn programming concepts without the overhead of creating and running entire applications.

## How to:
In Bash, your terminal is essentially a REPL. You type a command; it reads it, evaluates it, prints the outcome, and loops back awaiting your next command. Here's an example of using Bash as a REPL:

```Bash
$ echo "Hello, World!"
Hello, World!
$ x=$((6 * 7))
$ echo $x
42
```

Your input follows the `$ ` prompt, with the output printed on the next line. Simple, right?

## Deep Dive
Bash, short for Bourne Again SHell, is the default shell on many Unix-based systems. It's an upgrade to the original Bourne shell, built-in the late 1970s. While Bash is a powerful scripting tool, its interactive mode allows you to execute commands line by line.

When considering alternatives, you have the Python REPL (simply type `python` in your terminal), Node.js (with `node`), and IPython, an enhanced interactive Python shell. Every language tends to have its own REPL implementation.

Underneath, REPLs are loops that parse your input (commands or code), run it, and return the result to stdout (your screen), often using the language's interpreter directly. This immediacy of feedback is excellent for learning and prototyping.
