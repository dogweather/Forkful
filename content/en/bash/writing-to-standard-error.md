## What & Why?
Writing to standard error, `stderr`, outputs error messages separately from standard output, `stdout`. Programmers use `stderr` to report errors without messing with regular command outputs, which makes it easier to handle and log errors.

## How to:
```
# Redirect the echo command to standard error
echo "Error: Invalid input." >&2

# Using printf to write to standard error
printf "Error: File not found.\n" >&2

# Sample script that writes both to stdout and stderr
echo "Starting process..."
echo "Oops! Something went wrong." >&2
echo "Process complete."
```
Sample Output:
```
Starting process...
Process complete.
Oops! Something went wrong.
```
In the above, "Oops! Something went wrong." is sent to `stderr` and may appear out of order when mixed with `stdout` in a terminal since `stderr` is typically unbuffered.

## Deep Dive
Bash inherits the concept of 'file descriptors' from Unix, with `stdout` to fd `1` and `stderr` to fd `2`. Redirecting to `&2` sends the output to `stderr`. Historically, this separation allows for easier management and filtering, with `2>&1` being a common pattern to redirect `stderr` to `stdout`. A viable alternative to explicit redirection is to use `logger` for syslog integration or configuring the script to handle errors internally.
