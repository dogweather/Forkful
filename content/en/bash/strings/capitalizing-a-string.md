## How to:
Bash does not have a built-in function specifically for capitalizing strings, but you can accomplish this task using parameter expansion or external tools like `awk`. Here are a few ways to capitalize a string in Bash:

**Using Parameter Expansion:**

This method manipulates the string directly in the shell.

```bash
str="hello world"
capitalized="${str^}"
echo "$capitalized"
```
Output:
```
Hello world
```

**Using `awk`:**

`awk` is a powerful text processing tool available on most Unix-like operating systems, which can be utilized to capitalize strings.

```bash
str="hello world"
echo "$str" | awk '{print toupper(substr($0, 1, 1)) tolower(substr($0, 2))}'
```
Output:
```
Hello world
```

**Using `sed`:**

For a more traditional approach, `sed` can be employed to capitalize the first letter of a string. However, it's a bit more complex compared to the previous methods.

```bash
str="hello world"
echo "$str" | sed 's/./\u&/'
```
Output:
```
Hello world
```

These snippets demonstrate how to capitalize the first letter of a string in Bash, highlighting the flexibility of shell scripting when manipulating text.
