# Debug Debug: Print Debug Output In Bash

## What & Why?
Printing debug output means rendering textual information at runtime for possible errors. This helps verify your program works as expected. Ever forgotten a semi-colon and gone mad looking for it? Debug output saves you time and aspirin.

## How to:
In Bash, use `echo` or `printf`. Theyâ€™re simple, but powerful.

```Bash
# Test script with echo
echo "Start of script"
```

Output:
```Bash
Start of script
```

Or, for more control, `printf`. Don't forget the new line `\n`.

```Bash
# Test script with printf
printf "Start of script\n"
```

Output:
```Bash
Start of script
```

## Deep Dive
The `echo` command was present in the earliest versions of Unix. `printf` showed up in Unix V7 and is recommended nowadays due to stricter standards-compliant behavior.

Alternatives? `print` in Korn shell but it's non-standard. Stick with `printf`.

Under the hood, printing debug output doesn't happen in a vacuum: it writes to the standard output (stdout) file descriptor. Neat, huh?
