## Why

Converting dates into strings may seem like a simple task, but it has important applications in programming. By turning a date into a string, we can easily manipulate and display it in different formats, making our code more dynamic and user-friendly.

## How To

To convert a date into a string in C programming, we can use the `strftime` function from the `time.h` library. This function takes in a date and a format string as parameters and returns the date in the specified format.

To illustrate this, let's take a look at a simple code snippet:

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <time.h>

int main() {
   time_t now = time(NULL);

   char buffer[20];
   strftime(buffer, 20, "%Y-%m-%d", localtime(&now));

   printf("Today's date is: %s", buffer);

   return 0;
}
```

In this example, we first declare a `time_t` variable `now` and use the `time` function to get the current date and time. We then create a character array `buffer` with enough space to store our desired date format. Next, we use `strftime` to convert the current date into the specified format, which in this case is `"%Y-%m-%d"`, representing year-month-day.

Running this code will give us the output: `Today's date is: 2021-09-22`.

We can also include other elements in our format string, such as the day of the week or the time, to get a more comprehensive date and time display. `strftime` allows for a wide range of format options, so feel free to experiment and find the best fit for your needs.

## Deep Dive

When converting a date into a string, we must be mindful of the locale settings and the time zone of the system. These can affect the format of the resulting string or cause errors if not properly accounted for.

Additionally, we can encounter issues with leap years, DST (Daylight Saving Time), or the beginning and end of a month. These can be tackled by using the `mktime` function to convert a `struct tm` object into a `time_t` value before using `strftime`.
