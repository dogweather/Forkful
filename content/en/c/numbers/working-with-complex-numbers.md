## How to:
In C, complex numbers are supported by the Standard Library, specifically `<complex.h>`. To utilize them, declare variables with the `double complex` type (or `float complex` for single precision). Here's how to perform basic operations:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <complex.h>

int main() {
    double complex z1 = 1.0 + 2.0*I; // Declare a complex number 1+2i
    double complex z2 = 1.0 - 2.0*I; // Declare another complex number 1-2i
    
    // Addition
    double complex sum = z1 + z2;
    printf("Sum: %.2f + %.2fi\n", creal(sum), cimag(sum)); // Output: Sum: 2.00 + 0.00i

    // Multiplication
    double complex product = z1 * z2;
    printf("Product: %.2f + %.2fi\n", creal(product), cimag(product)); // Output: Product: 5.00 + 0.00i

    // Complex Conjugate
    double complex conjugate = conj(z1);
    printf("Conjugate of z1: %.2f + %.2fi\n", creal(conjugate), cimag(conjugate)); // Output: Conjugate of z1: 1.00 - 2.00i
    
    // Magnitude
    double magnitude = cabs(z1);
    printf("Magnitude of z1: %.2f\n", magnitude); // Output: Magnitude of z1: 2.24

    // Phase
    double phase = carg(z1);
    printf("Phase of z1: %.2f\n", phase); // Output in radians
    
    return 0;
}
```
Note that `I` is a constant representing the imaginary unit in `<complex.h>`. Functions like `creal()` and `cimag()` extract real and imaginary parts, respectively, while `conj()` computes the complex conjugate. For the magnitude and phase (argument) of complex numbers, `cabs()` and `carg()` are used.

## Deep Dive
The support for complex numbers in C is relatively recent, having been standardized in C99. Prior to this, complex number arithmetic in C was cumbersome, often requiring custom data structures and functions. The inclusion of `<complex.h>` and the complex data types provided a significant boost to the language's capabilities for scientific and engineering applications. However, it's worth noting that some languages, like Python, offer more intuitive support for complex numbers through built-in data types and a richer set of library functions. Despite this, the performance and control offered by C make it a preferred choice for high-performance computing tasks, even if it means dealing with a slightly more verbose syntax for complex arithmetic.
