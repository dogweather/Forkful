## How to:
In C, logging can be achieved with basic file operations or using more sophisticated libraries. For simplicity, we'll start with the standard I/O library. The following snippets showcase basic logging implementations.

To log simple messages:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    FILE *logFile;
    logFile = fopen("application.log", "a"); // Open the log file in append mode
    
    if (logFile == NULL) {
        perror("Error opening log file.");
        return -1;
    }
    
    fprintf(logFile, "Starting application.\n");
    
    // Your application logic here
    
    fprintf(logFile, "Application finished successfully.\n");
    fclose(logFile);
    
    return 0;
}
```

Output in `application.log`:

```
Starting application.
Application finished successfully.
```

To include more detailed logs with timestamps and log levels:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <time.h>

void logMessage(FILE *logFile, const char* level, const char* message) {
    time_t now;
    time(&now);
    char* datetime = ctime(&now);
    datetime[strlen(datetime)-1] = '\0'; // Remove newline character
    fprintf(logFile, "[%s] %s - %s\n", datetime, level, message);
}

int main() {
    FILE *logFile;
    logFile = fopen("detailed.log", "a");
    
    if (logFile == NULL) {
        perror("Error opening log file.");
        return -1;
    }
    
    logMessage(logFile, "INFO", "Application starting");
    // Your application logic here
    logMessage(logFile, "ERROR", "An example error");
    
    fclose(logFile);
    
    return 0;
}
```

Output in `detailed.log`:

```
[Thu Mar 10 14:32:01 2023] INFO - Application starting
[Thu Mar 10 14:32:02 2023] ERROR - An example error
```

## Deep Dive
Logging in C, as demonstrated, relies on simple file operations, which is effective but not as powerful or flexible as logging facilities in other languages, such as Python's `logging` module or Java's `Log4j`. For more advanced logging capabilities in C, developers often turn to libraries like `syslog` on Unix-like systems, which provides system-wide log management, or third-party libraries such as `log4c`.

Historically, logging has been an integral part of programming, tracing back to early programming practices where tracking and understanding program flow and errors were primarily done through physical printouts. As systems evolved, logging became more sophisticated, now supporting various levels of severity, log rotation, and asynchronous logging.

While C's standard library provides the basic tools for implementing logging, its limitations often lead to the creation of custom logging frameworks or the adoption of external libraries for more feature-rich and flexible logging solutions. Despite these limitations, understanding and implementing basic logging in C is crucial for debugging and maintaining software, especially in environments where external dependencies are to be minimized.
