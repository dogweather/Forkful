## How to:
In C, a function is declared with a return type, a name, and parameters (if any), followed by a block of code. Let's start with a simple example: a function that adds two integers.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Function declaration
int add(int a, int b);

int main() {
  int sum = add(5, 3);
  printf("The sum is: %d\n", sum);
  return 0;
}

// Function definition
int add(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

Output:
```
The sum is: 8
```

Now, let's look at a more complex example involving a custom data type. This function calculates the area of a rectangle.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Define a structure for a rectangle
typedef struct {
  int width;
  int height;
} Rectangle;

// Function to calculate the area of a rectangle
int calculateArea(Rectangle rect) {
  return rect.width * rect.height;
}

int main() {
  Rectangle myRect = {5, 10};
  int area = calculateArea(myRect);
  printf("The area of the rectangle is: %d\n", area);
  return 0;
}
```

Output:
```
The area of the rectangle is: 50
```

## Deep Dive
The concept of functions in C, inherited from earlier programming practices, is fundamental to structured programming. Functions allow developers to abstract away details, manage complexity, and organize their code logically. Since its inception, the function has been a core construct in C, influencing numerous other languages.

However, as programming paradigms have evolved, alternative approaches like object-oriented programming (OOP) in languages such as C++ and Java, have extended the concept of functions with methods associated with objects. Although C does not support OOP out of the box, it's possible to mimic object-oriented designs by carefully structuring functions and data.

In modern programming, functions remain crucial, but with advancements in compiler optimizations and language features, the emphasis might shift towards inline functions and templates in C++ or lambdas in languages like Python and JavaScript. These provide more flexibility and often more concise syntax for achieving similar modularity and reusability. However, the fundamental principles learned through organizing code in functions in C are universally applicable and form the foundation of efficient and effective software development.
