## What & Why?

Converting a string to lowercase in C involves transforming all uppercase letters in a given string to their corresponding lowercase equivalents. Programmers often perform this operation to standardize text input for comparison, search operations, or simply for aesthetic consistency in output.

## How to:

C doesn't have a built-in function for string conversion to lowercase directly, unlike some high-level languages. However, the process can be easily implemented using the C standard library functions. Below is a step-by-step guide and an example illustrating how to convert a string to lowercase.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <ctype.h>

void toLowerCase(char *str) {
    while (*str) {
        *str = tolower(*str);
        str++;
    }
}

int main() {
    char text[] = "Hello, World!";
    printf("Original: %s\n", text);

    toLowerCase(text);
    printf("Lowercase: %s\n", text);

    return 0;
}
```

**Sample Output:**

```
Original: Hello, World!
Lowercase: hello, world!
```

In this example, the `toLowerCase` function iterates through each character of the input string, converting it to its lowercase equivalent using the `tolower` function from `ctype.h`. The modification is done in place, altering the original string.

## Deep Dive

The `tolower` function used in the example above is part of the C standard library, specifically within the `ctype.h` header file. It operates based on the current locale, but for the standard "C" locale, it handles the ASCII character set where 'A' to 'Z' are converted to 'a' to 'z'.

Historically, handling character encoding and case conversion in C was tightly coupled with the ASCII character set, limiting its utility in international or localized applications where characters outside the ASCII set are common. Modern programming languages might offer built-in string methods to perform case conversion considering locale and Unicode characters, which C lacks natively.

In scenarios requiring extensive text manipulation, especially with non-ASCII characters, programmers might consider using libraries that offer better internationalization support, such as ICU (International Components for Unicode). However, for most applications dealing with ASCII text, the approach demonstrated is efficient and straightforward. It highlights C's propensity for giving programmers control over data manipulation, albeit with a bit more legwork involved compared to higher-level languages.
