## Why
Generating random numbers is a common task in programming, especially in simulation, gaming, and cryptography. Random numbers provide variety and unpredictability, making programs more interesting and secure.

## How To
To generate random numbers in C programming, we can use the `rand()` and `srand()` functions from the standard library `stdlib.h`. These functions are based on a pseudo-random number generator, meaning the numbers generated are not truly random but appear to be random.

Here's an example of generating 5 random numbers between 1 and 10 using `rand()`:

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
  int i;
  for(i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    int num = rand() % 10 + 1;
    printf("%d ", num);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Output:
```
7 3 9 10 6
```

The `srand()` function is used to set the seed for the sequence of numbers generated by `rand()`. This is important because without setting the seed, the same sequence of numbers will be generated every time the program runs. To set the seed as the current time, we can use the `time()` function from `time.h`.

Here's an example of generating the same sequence of random numbers using `srand()`:

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>

int main() {
  srand(time(0));
  int i;
  for(i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    int num = rand() % 10 + 1;
    printf("%d ", num);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Output:
```
2 1 8 6 4
```

## Deep Dive
As mentioned before, the `rand` function uses a pseudo-random number generator, meaning the numbers generated are not truly random. To improve the randomness, we can use the `random` function from `stdlib.h` instead. This function uses a stronger algorithm to generate numbers and also allows for a larger range of numbers to be generated.

We can also use the `drand48` function to generate random floating-point numbers between 0 and 1. This function uses the Linear Congruential Generator(LCG) algorithm, which is a type of pseudo-random number generator.
