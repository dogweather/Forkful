## What & Why?

Generating random numbers in C involves creating sequences of numbers that lack any discernable pattern, mimicking the concept of randomness. Programmers leverage random numbers for a myriad of purposes, including simulating data, cryptographic applications, and game development, making it a vital aspect of programming.

## How to:

To generate random numbers in C, you typically use the `rand()` function found in `stdlib.h`. However, it's crucial to seed the random number generator to ensure variability in the generated numbers across different program executions. The `srand()` function, seeded with a value, often the current time, facilitates this.

Here's a simple example of generating a random number between 0 and 99:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>

int main() {
    // Seed the random number generator
    srand((unsigned) time(NULL));

    // Generate a random number between 0 and 99
    int randomNumber = rand() % 100;

    // Print the random number
    printf("Random Number: %d\n", randomNumber);

    return 0;
}
```

Sample output:

```
Random Number: 42
```

It's important to note that each execution of this program will produce a new random number, thanks to the seeding with the current time.

## Deep Dive

The traditional way of generating random numbers in C, using `rand()` and `srand()`, isn't truly random. It's pseudorandom. This is fine for many applications, but it falls short in situations requiring high degrees of randomness, such as in serious cryptographic uses. The sequence generated by `rand()` is entirely determined by the seed provided to `srand()`. Thus, if the seed is known, the sequence can be predicted, reducing randomness.

Historically, the `rand()` function has been critiqued for its low-quality randomness and limited range. Modern alternatives include using device-specific APIs or external libraries that better approximate true randomness or, in UNIX-like systems, reading from `/dev/random` or `/dev/urandom` for cryptographic purposes.

For example, using `/dev/urandom` in C:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    FILE *fp;
    unsigned int randomNumber;

    // Open /dev/urandom for reading
    fp = fopen("/dev/urandom", "r");

    // Read a random number
    fread(&randomNumber, sizeof(randomNumber), 1, fp);

    // Print the random number
    printf("Random Number: %u\n", randomNumber);

    // Close the file
    fclose(fp);

    return 0;
}
```

This method reads directly from the system's entropy pool, offering a higher quality of randomness suitable for more sensitive applications. However, this approach may have portability issues across different platforms, making it less universal than using `rand()`. 

Regardless of the method, understanding the nature of randomness and its implementation in C is crucial for developing effective, secure, and engaging applications.
