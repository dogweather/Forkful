## What & Why?
An interactive shell, or Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL), is a tool providing a real-time coding environment to test snippets of code instantly. Programmers use it for quick feedback during development, learning, and debugging.

## How to:
C doesn't come with a built-in REPL, but you can use third-party tools. Here's a glimpse using Cling, a C++ interpreter that can also handle C code:

```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, REPL world!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

Output in Cling REPL:
```
[cling]$ .x yourscript.c
Hello, REPL world!
```

Cling executes the script and prints the output instantly.

## Deep Dive
REPLs are standard in dynamic languages like Python or Ruby, but for compiled languages like C, they're less common. Historically, the compile-run-debug cycle didn't lend itself to interactive exploration. Tools like Cling and online C compilers offer REPL-like experiences by wrapping your C code in a C++ environment.

Alternatives to Cling include C interpreters like CINT and Ch. These tools allow for quick iteration but may not be suitable for all development scenarios due to performance constraints and support for complex features.

Implementation of a REPL in a compiled language involves compiling and executing code snippets on the fly, which is non-trivial and may have limitations compared to the full language capabilities.
