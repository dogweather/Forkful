# Regular Expressions in C Programming

## What & Why?
Regular expressions (regex) are sequences of characters that form search patterns. They are used in programming for matching, searching, and manipulating text strings. 

## How to: 
Using regex in C programming typically involves the `regex.h` library. Let's dive right in and write a simple program that checks if the user's input is a valid email:

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <regex.h>

int main() {
    regex_t regex;
    int return_value;
    char email[100];

    return_value = regcomp(&regex, "^[a-zA-Z0-9_.+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+\\.[a-zA-Z0-9-.]+$", 0);
    
    printf("Enter your email: ");
    fgets(email, 100, stdin);

    return_value = regexec(&regex, email, 0, NULL, 0);
    
    if(!return_value)
        printf("Valid Email.\n");
    else if(return_value == REG_NOMATCH)
        printf("Invalid Email.\n");
    else
        printf("An error occurred.\n");

    regfree(&regex);

    return 0;
}
```
This code compiles the regex for a valid email and uses `regexec()` to match it against the user's input.

## Deep Dive
Regular expressions have been around since the early 1960s, and have become an integral part of text parsing and manipulation in almost all high-level programming languages. 

In C programming, one could argue there are simpler methods for some specific tasks. However, regex provides powerful versatility unmatched by methods such as `strstr()` or `strpbrk()`. 

In terms of implementation details, note that `regcomp()` compiles a regular expression into a form that `regexec()` can use, and `regfree()` frees up any memory that `regcomp()` allocated.
