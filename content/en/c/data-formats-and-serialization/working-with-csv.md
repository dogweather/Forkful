## What & Why?

In the realm of programming, working with CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files involves reading from and writing data to text files organized by rows, where each row represents a record and each record's fields are separated by commas. Programmers manipulate CSV files for ease of data import/export across various systems, due to their widespread support and simplicity for storing tabular data.

## How to:

### Reading CSV Files
To read a CSV file in C, we use standard file I/O functions along with string manipulation functions to parse each line. Below is a basic example of reading a CSV file and printing each row's fields to the console.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    FILE *fp = fopen("data.csv", "r");
    if (!fp) {
        printf("Can't open file\n");
        return 1;
    }

    char buf[1024];
    while (fgets(buf, 1024, fp)) {
        char *field = strtok(buf, ",");
        while(field) {
            printf("%s\n", field);
            field = strtok(NULL, ",");
        }
    }

    fclose(fp);
    return 0;
}
```
Sample `data.csv`:
```
Name,Age,Occupation
John Doe,29,Software Engineer
```

Sample Output:
```
Name
Age
Occupation
John Doe
29
Software Engineer
```

### Writing to CSV Files
Similarly, writing to a CSV file involves using `fprintf` to save data in a comma-separated format.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    FILE *fp = fopen("output.csv", "w");
    if (!fp) {
        printf("Can't open file\n");
        return 1;
    }

    char *headers[] = {"Name", "Age", "Occupation", NULL};
    for (int i = 0; headers[i] != NULL; i++) {
        fprintf(fp, "%s%s", headers[i], (headers[i+1] != NULL) ? "," : "\n");
    }
    fprintf(fp, "%s,%d,%s\n", "Jane Doe", 27, "Data Scientist");

    fclose(fp);
    return 0;
}
```

Sample `output.csv` Content:
```
Name,Age,Occupation
Jane Doe,27,Data Scientist
```

## Deep Dive

The CSV format, though seemingly straightforward, comes with its nuances, such as handling commas within fields and encapsulating fields with quotes. The rudimentary examples shown do not account for such complexities, nor do they handle potential errors robustly. 

Historically, CSV handling in C has largely been manual due to the language's low-level nature and lack of built-in high-level abstractions for such tasks. This manual management includes opening files, reading lines, splitting strings, and converting data types as needed.

While direct manipulation of CSV files in C provides valuable learning experiences on file I/O and string handling, several modern alternatives promise efficiency and less error-prone processes. Libraries like `libcsv` and `csv-parser` offer comprehensive functions for reading and writing CSV files, including support for quoted fields and custom delimiters.

Alternatively, when working within ecosystems that support it, integrating with languages or platforms that provide high-level CSV manipulation functions (like Python with its `pandas` library) can be a more productive route for applications requiring heavy CSV processing. This cross-language approach leverages C's performance and systems programming capabilities while utilizing the ease of use from other languages for specific tasks such as CSV handling.
