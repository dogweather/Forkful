## What & Why?
Complex numbers, a mix of real and imaginary parts (like 3 + 4i), are key in advanced calculations, like signal processing or solving certain equations. Programmers handle them for math-heavy applications where traditional numbers don't cut it.

## How to:
C, since C99, has a native complex type and library. Here's how to use it:

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <complex.h>

int main() {
    // Declare two complex numbers
    double complex z1 = 1.0 + 3.0 * I;
    double complex z2 = 2.0 - 2.0 * I;

    // Operations with complex numbers
    double complex sum = z1 + z2;
    double complex mult = z1 * z2;

    // Printing the results
    printf("Sum: %.1f + %.1fi\n", creal(sum), cimag(sum));
    printf("Product: %.1f + %.1fi\n", creal(mult), cimag(mult));

    // Absolute value & phase angle
    printf("Abs(z1): %f\n", cabs(z1));
    printf("Arg(z1): %f\n", carg(z1));

    return 0;
}
```

Sample Output:
```
Sum: 3.0 + 1.0i
Product: 8.0 + 2.0i
Abs(z1): 3.162278
Arg(z1): 1.249046
```
## Deep Dive
Complex numbers go back centuries, with roots in 16th-century algebra. Fast forward, they're now a staple in many programming languages, not just C. 

C99 standard introduced `<complex.h>`, a header defining macros, functions, and the `complex` data type. Alternatives exist - like creating your own structure, but why reinvent the wheel? The C standard library is optimized and ready-to-go.

Despite its power, C's complex support isn't without critics. It can be less intuitive than similar features in languages like Python, and handling corner cases can get tricky. But for raw performance, it's still a solid choice.
