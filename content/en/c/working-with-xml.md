## What & Why?
Working with XML in C involves parsing, creating, and manipulating XML files - essentially structured data storage. Programmers do this to interact with data in a portable and human-readable format, often used for configuration, data exchange, and more.

## How to:
Below is a snippet using the `libxml2` library for parsing an XML file and grabbing the root element.

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <libxml/parser.h>
#include <libxml/tree.h>

int main() {
    xmlDoc *doc = NULL;
    xmlNode *root_element = NULL;

    // Parse the XML file
    doc = xmlReadFile("example.xml", NULL, 0);

    // Get the root element
    root_element = xmlDocGetRootElement(doc);

    printf("Root Element: %s\n", root_element->name);

    // Free the document
    xmlFreeDoc(doc);

    // Cleanup parser
    xmlCleanupParser();

    return 0;
}
```

Sample output for an XML with root `<data>` might be:
```
Root Element: data
```

## Deep Dive
XML, or Extensible Markup Language, dates back to the late '90s, providing a way to describe and structure data. In C, `libxml2` is the go-to. It's robust, though not the easiest for XML noobs. Alternatives include `tinyxml2`, which is lighter and more beginner-friendly. As for implementation, C doesn't have built-in XML support, so libraries fill the gap. They vary in size, speed, complexity, and portability. Most offer DOM and SAX parsing methods: DOM loads the entire thing into memory, good for small docs; SAX is event-driven, handling elements on the fly, better for big files. Both have their use cases and trade-offs.
