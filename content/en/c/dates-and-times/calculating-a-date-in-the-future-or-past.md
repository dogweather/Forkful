## What & Why?
Calculating a date in the future or past involves determining a specific date by adding or subtracting a certain number of days, months, or years from a given date. Programmers do this for tasks such as scheduling events, generating reminders, or handling expiration dates, making it an essential functionality in various applications, from calendaring systems to financial software.

## How to:
While the C standard library does not provide direct functions for date arithmetic, you can manipulate dates using the `time.h` library, specifically working with the `time_t` data type and `struct tm`. Here's a simplified example of how to add days to the current date:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <time.h>

void addDays(struct tm* date, int daysToAdd) {
    const time_t ONE_DAY = 24 * 60 * 60; // seconds in one day
    // Convert tm structure to time_t, add the days, and convert back
    time_t date_seconds = mktime(date) + (daysToAdd * ONE_DAY);
    *date = *localtime(&date_seconds);
}

int main() {
    time_t now;
    time(&now);
    struct tm futureDate = *localtime(&now);

    int daysToAdd = 10; // Adjust this for desired days to add
    addDays(&futureDate, daysToAdd);

    printf("Future Date: %d-%d-%d\n", futureDate.tm_year + 1900, futureDate.tm_mon + 1, futureDate.tm_mday);

    return 0;
}
```

This code adds a specified number of days to the current date and prints the future date. Note that the approach considers leap seconds and daylight saving time adjustments as handled by `mktime` and `localtime`.

Sample Output:

```
Future Date: 2023-04-23
```

Keep in mind, this example adds days, but with more complex calculations (like months or years, considering leap years), you'd need more sophisticated logic or libraries like `date.h` in C++ or third-party libraries in C.

## Deep Dive
Manipulating dates in C using the time.h library involves direct manipulation of time in seconds since the Unix epoch (00:00, Jan 1, 1970, UTC), followed by converting those seconds back into a more human-readable date format (`struct tm`). This approach is simplistic but effective for basic operations and benefits from being cross-platform and part of the C standard library.

However, this method's simplicity is also a limitation. Dealing with more complex date calculations (such as accounting for varying month lengths, leap years, and time zones) quickly becomes non-trivial. Languages like Python with `datetime` or Java with `java.time` provide more intuitive APIs for date arithmetic, embracing object-oriented principles for clarity and ease of use. 

In practice, when working on projects requiring extensive date manipulation in C, developers often turn to third-party libraries for more robust solutions. These libraries can offer comprehensive date and time functionalities, including timezone handling, formatting options, and more nuanced date arithmetic capabilities, significantly simplifying the developer's task.

Despite the availability of more modern alternatives, understanding how to manipulate dates using the C standard library remains a valuable skill. It provides deep insights into how computers represent and work with time, a fundamental concept that transcends specific programming languages.
