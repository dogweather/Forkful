## What & Why?
Creating a temporary file in C involves generating a file that is meant to be used for a short duration, usually as scratch space for data processing or storage. Programmers do it to manage temporary data without affecting the program's permanent storage or to ensure sensitive data is erased after use.

## How to:
Creating a temporary file in the C programming language can leverage functions such as `tmpfile()` and `mkstemp()`. 

**Using `tmpfile()`**: This function creates a unique temporary file that is automatically deleted when the program terminates or the file is closed.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    FILE *temp = tmpfile();
    if (temp == NULL) {
        perror("Failed to create temporary file");
        return 1;
    }

    // Writing data to the temporary file
    fputs("This is a test.\n", temp);

    // Rewind and read what we wrote
    rewind(temp);
    char buffer[1024];
    while (fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), temp) != NULL) {
        printf("%s", buffer);
    }

    // Automatically deleted on close or program exit
    fclose(temp);

    return 0;
}
```
**Sample output:**
```
This is a test.
```

**Using `mkstemp()`**: Provides more control over the temporary file's location and its permissions. It requires a template string that ends with `XXXXXX` which it then replaces with a unique sequence to prevent name collisions.

```c
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <fcntl.h>

int main() {
    char template[] = "/tmp/mytemp-XXXXXX";
    int fd = mkstemp(template);

    if (fd == -1) {
        perror("Failed to create temporary file");
        return 1;
    }
    
    printf("Temporary file created: %s\n", template);

    // Temporary files created with mkstemp() should be deleted manually
    unlink(template);

    close(fd);
    return 0;
}
```
**Sample output:**
```
Temporary file created: /tmp/mytemp-abc123
```

## Deep Dive
The concept of temporary files is not unique to C but is a common functionality in many programming environments due to its utility in handling ephemeral data. The `tmpfile()` function, standardized in the ISO C standard, creates a file with a unique name in a standard directory, but its existence is fleeting, making it ideal for secure or temporary operations.

One notable limitation of `tmpfile()` is its reliance on the default temporary directory, which might not be suitable for all applications especially in terms of permissions or security. In contrast, `mkstemp()` allows specifying the directory and ensures secure file creation with guaranteed unique filenames by modifying the provided template string, offering a more versatile solution at the expense of manual file management.

However, creating temporary files can introduce security vulnerabilities, such as race conditions, if not handled properly. For instance, `tmpfile()` and `mkstemp()` address different aspects of secure temporary file creation (automatic deletion and secure name generation, respectively), but neither is a panacea. Developers must consider the specifics of their application's security needs, including potential vulnerabilities introduced by temporary files, and may need to implement additional safeguards beyond what these functions provide.

In the broader landscape of programming, alternatives such as in-memory storage (e.g., using dynamic data structures or memory-mapped files) might offer better performance or security for temporary data handling. Nevertheless, physical temporary files remain a crucial tool in many scenarios, especially for large data sets or when inter-process communication is involved.
