## Why 

Testing in programming is often seen as a tedious and time-consuming task, but it is an essential part of the development process. It helps to catch bugs and errors early on, reducing the chances of them causing problems in the future. Writing tests also allows for easier and more efficient debugging of code, leading to a more robust and reliable program.

## How To 

Writing tests in C programming language can be done using various frameworks such as Unity, Check, or CUnit. In this blog post, we will focus on using Unity, a popular unit testing framework for C.

To get started, first, create a C file named "test.c" and include the necessary Unity header file.

```C
#include "unity.h"
```

Next, we create a function using the `TEST()`macro provided by Unity, which will be our test case. The function takes two parameters - the name of the test case and the setup function.

```C
TEST(test_case_name, setup_function) {
    // test code goes here
}
```

Inside the test function, we can use various Unity assertion macros to verify different conditions. For example, the `UNITY_ASSERT_EQUAL` macro can be used to check if two values are equal.

```C
UNITY_ASSERT_EQUAL(expected, actual);
```

After writing all the necessary assertions, we use the `UNITY_END()` macro to indicate the end of the test case.

```C
TEST(test_case_name, setup_function) {
    // test code goes here
    UNITY_END();
}
```

Finally, we tie all our test cases together in the `main()` function by calling `UNITY_BEGIN()` and `UNITY_END()`.

```C
int main(void) {
    UNITY_BEGIN();
    RUN_TEST(test_case_name);
    // add more test cases here
    UNITY_END();

    return 0;
}
```

To run the tests, compile the file and run the executable. The output will display the number of tests run, passed, and failed, along with the name of each test case and their result.

## Deep Dive 

Writing effective tests requires careful planning and consideration. One of the key principles of writing tests is to focus on testing the functionality or behavior of individual units or components rather than the entire program. This allows for easier identification and isolation of bugs and errors.

Another important aspect of writing tests is to ensure that they are independent and can be run in any order. This helps in avoiding any unexpected side effects or dependencies between test cases.

There are various types of tests that can be written, such as unit tests, integration tests, and regression tests. Each type serves a different purpose and should be used accordingly in the development process.

In addition to writing tests, it is also crucial to continuously run and update them as the codebase evolves and changes. This ensures that new code additions do not break existing functionality.
