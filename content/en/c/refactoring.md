## What & Why?
Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code without changing its external behavior. Programmers do it to improve readability, reduce complexity, or make the code more maintainable and scalable, which can save a truckload of time and headaches down the road.

## How to:
Let’s spruce up some code. Imagine you've got a function that calculates the average of integers in an array. At first glance, it's a bit of a tangled mess. 

**Before Refactoring:**
```C
#include <stdio.h>

double calculateStuff(int numbers[], int size) {
    int sum = 0;
    double average;
    for(int i = 0; i < size; sum += numbers[i++]); // Summing in the for-loop condition, ouch!
    average = (double)sum / size;
    return average;
}

int main() {
    int array[] = {23, 42, 57, 16, 5, 102};
    int length = sizeof(array) / sizeof(array[0]);
    printf("Average: %f\n", calculateStuff(array, length));

    return 0;
}
```

**After Refactoring:**
```C
#include <stdio.h>

int calculateSum(const int numbers[], int size) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
        sum += numbers[i];
    }
    return sum;
}

double calculateAverage(const int numbers[], int size) {
    int sum = calculateSum(numbers, size);
    return (double)sum / size;
}

int main() {
    int array[] = {23, 42, 57, 16, 5, 102};
    int length = sizeof(array) / sizeof(array[0]);
    printf("Average: %f\n", calculateAverage(array, length));
    return 0;
}
```
Even with this simple example, you can see how splitting the function makes the code cleaner and more maintainable. Each function has a single responsibility now – a key principle in clean coding.

## Deep Dive
The term "refactoring" was popularized in the late 90s, particularly with the publication of Martin Fowler's book "Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code." Refactoring doesn't imply fixing bugs or adding new features, rather it's about improving the structure of the code.

There are many spiffy refactoring tools and IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) that help automate the process, like CLion for C and C++, but understanding what's going on under the hood remains crucial.

Alternatives to refactoring can include rewriting code from scratch (risky and often unnecessary) or living with the technical debt (which can be more costly in the long run). Implementation details vary based on the project, but common refactorings include renaming variables for clarity, breaking large functions into smaller ones, and replacing magic numbers with named constants.

Also, patterns like DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and SOLID principles can guide your refactoring journey, pushing for a codebase that’s easier to test, understand, and collaborate on.
