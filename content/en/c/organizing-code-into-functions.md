## What & Why?
Organizing code into functions is about breaking down the code into reusable blocks that perform specific tasks. It makes code easier to read, debug, and maintain.

## How to:
Let's take a simple example: say, you want to add two numbers multiple times.

Without functions:
```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int sum1 = 5 + 3;
    printf("Sum1: %d\n", sum1);
    
    int sum2 = 2 + 8;
    printf("Sum2: %d\n", sum2);
    
    // More additions here...
    
    return 0;
}
```

With functions:
```C
#include <stdio.h>

int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    int sum1 = add(5, 3);
    printf("Sum1: %d\n", sum1);
    
    int sum2 = add(2, 8);
    printf("Sum2: %d\n", sum2);
    
    // Use add() function for more additions...
    
    return 0;
}
```

Output:
```
Sum1: 8
Sum2: 10
```

## Deep Dive
Before C had functions, programming was often done in a linear fashion, much like a recipe. But as programs grew, code duplication became a problem. Functions were the solution - they allowed us to execute the same code block from different parts of a program without rewriting it every time. This not only saves space but also time when making updates: change the function in one place, and every part of your code that uses it gets the update.

Alternatives to functions might include inline code, macros, or copy-and-paste coding, but these can lead to bloated, error-prone, and hard-to-maintain code. Functions, by contrast, encapsulate functionality, define clear interfaces, and can reduce side effects with proper use of scope.

When you're implementing functions, consider a couple of details: one, try to make them do just one thing – this is known as the Single Responsibility Principle. Two, names are important – choose descriptive names for functions and their parameters to make your code self-documenting.
