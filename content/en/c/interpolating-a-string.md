## What & Why?

String interpolation lets us insert variables directly into strings. It's handy to dynamically create text, like personalized messages or formatted data.

## How to:

C doesn't have built-in string interpolation, but we improvise with `sprintf` or `snprintf`. Here's how:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char name[] = "Alex";
    int age = 29;
    char message[50];

    snprintf(message, sizeof(message), "Hi, I'm %s, and I am %d years old.", name, age);
    printf("%s\n", message);  // Sample output: Hi, I'm Alex, and I am 29 years old.

    return 0;
}
```

## Deep Dive:

C has always been a bit hands-on with strings. Interpolation ain't a direct feature – instead, we use placeholders and format specifiers like `%s` for strings or `%d` for digits within functions like `printf` or `sprintf`.

Historically, developers in other languages got spoiled with interpolation goodies. In C#, you'd just do `var message = $"Hello, {name}!";`. Swift and Ruby have their own sugar too.

Back in our C yard, format specifiers do the heavy lifting. Remember, `sprintf` can be risky if you get the buffer size wrong and you might end up overrunning your buffer (`snprintf` is safer due to buffer limit). Plus, managing this manually means more control - a beloved principle in the C ethos.

There's more than one way to skin a cat though: third-party libraries, like GLib, introduce nicer string utilities. Functions like `g_strdup_printf` act similar to `sprintf` but handle memory allocation for you.

Variadic macros and functions can also simulate interpolation, but that's an advanced play requiring firm grasp on macros and the `va_list` type from `<stdarg.h>`.
