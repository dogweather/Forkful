## How to:
In VBA, you primarily use the `Mid`, `Left`, and `Right` functions to extract substrings. Below, we explore these functions with examples:

1. **Mid**: Extracts a substring from a string starting at a specified position.
   ```basic
   Dim exampleString As String
   exampleString = "Hello World"
   Dim result As String
   result = Mid(exampleString, 7, 5)
   Debug.Print result  ' Output: World
   ```

2. **Left**: Extracts a substring from the left of the string, up to a specified number of characters.
   ```basic
   Dim exampleString As String
   exampleString = "Hello World"
   Dim result As String
   result = Left(exampleString, 5)
   Debug.Print result  ' Output: Hello
   ```

3. **Right**: Extracts a substring from the right of the string, up to a specified number of characters.
   ```basic
   Dim exampleString As String
   exampleString = "Hello World"
   Dim result As String
   result = Right(exampleString, 5)
   Debug.Print result  ' Output: World
   ```

These fundamental functions form the bedrock of substring extraction in VBA, providing robust and straightforward approaches to string manipulation.

## Deep Dive:
Historically, the ability to manipulate strings in programming has been essential, with BASIC (the progenitor of VBA) being among the first to democratize this capability in the early days of personal computing. The `Mid`, `Left`, and `Right` functions in VBA inherit this legacy, offering a simplified interface for modern programmers.

While these functions are quite effective for many tasks, the emergence of Regular Expressions in newer languages has provided a more powerful and flexible way to work with text. Despite this, the immediate simplicity and availability of the traditional VBA substring functions make them perfectly suited for quick tasks and those new to programming. 

For more complex parsing and search operations within strings, VBA also supports pattern matching through the `Like` operator and Regular Expressions via the `VBScript.RegExp` object, though these require a bit more setup and understanding to use effectively. While these tools offer greater power, the straightforward nature of `Mid`, `Left`, and `Right` ensure their continued relevance and utility in many VBA programs.
