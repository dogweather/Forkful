# Haskell String Length: A Simple Guide

## What & Why?
Finding the length of a string is to determine how many characters it contains. Itâ€™s a pretty common task in programming, useful in scenarios like data validation and resource allocation.

## How to:
Finding the length of a string in Haskell is straightforward. You use the `length` function. Here's how.

```Haskell
main = do
    let str = "Hacker News"
    print(length str)
```
When you run the program, the output would be:
```Haskell
11
```

In this case, the string `"Hacker News"` is composed of 11 characters, including the space.

## Deep Dive
Historically, measuring the length of a string was crucial to manage memory. Today, although high-level languages handle most of this for us, it remains an essential skill. 

If efficiency is your concern, beware - Haskell's `length` function can be costly for large strings since it must traverse the entire string. An alternative approach can be using the `Data.Text.length` function that works on strict and lazy Text. But remember, it counts Unicode characters, not bytes. 

```Haskell
import qualified Data.Text as T
main = do
    let str = T.pack "Haskell"
    print(T.length str)
```
Implementation speaking, Haskell's length function operates on Lists, which Strings are just a type of. It's a pure function without side effects that counts the items in a list till it reaches an empty list (`[]`).
