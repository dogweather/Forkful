## What & Why?
Reading a text file in programming lets your code absorb data, like pouring coffee into your brain in the morning. We do it to feed programs information they wouldn't have otherwise, like settings, data to process, or instructions to act upon.

## How to:
Here's how you get Haskell to read text files without breaking a sweat. Crack open your favorite editor, and let's write some code.

```Haskell
import System.IO

main = do
    -- Open a file in read mode
    handle <- openFile "hello.txt" ReadMode
    -- Read the file's contents
    content <- hGetContents handle
    -- Print the file's contents
    putStrLn content
    -- Don't forget to close the file handle!
    hClose handle
```

Run this, and if you have "hello.txt" with "Hello, World!" inside, you get:

```
Hello, World!
```

Here's a shorter, slicker way, doing the same with less fuss:

```Haskell
-- The 'readFile' does the open and read in one go
main = do
    content <- readFile "hello.txt"
    putStrLn content
```

Output's still,

```
Hello, World!
```

## Deep Dive

Long ago, programs were asocial creatures, mostly processing data they generated themselves. But complexity grew, and so did the need to pull in outside info, thus reading from files became a staple.

Haskell provides various ways to read files. We can do it the low-level way with `openFile`, `hGetContents`, and `hClose` or play it cool with `readFile`, which bundles everything neatly. 

`readFile` is lazy â€“ it reads contents as needed, which is memory efficient for large files but can lead to surprises if the file changes midway. The low-level approach gives more control, making it more predictable but also more verbose. For gargantuan texts, Haskell's `hGetLine` or libraries like `conduit` and `pipes` help manage memory and processing more finely.

Haskell's standard `IO` actions handle files using the underlying OS mechanisms. The libraries abstract these into more user-friendly operations but at the end of the day, they're built atop Haskell's `IO` monad, which ensures actions happen in the right order.
