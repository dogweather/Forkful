## How to:
In Haskell, writing to stderr is straightforward with the base library's `System.IO` module. Below is a basic example to demonstrate:

```haskell
import System.IO

main :: IO ()
main = do
  hPutStrLn stderr "This is an error message."
```

The output of this program to stderr would be:

```
This is an error message.
```

If you're working in a more complex application, or if you need better control over logging (including errors), you might opt for a third-party library. One popular choice is `monad-logger` which integrates with the `mtl` style of Haskell programming. Here's a small snippet using `monad-logger`:

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
import Control.Monad.Logger

main :: IO ()
main = runStderrLoggingT $ do
  logErrorN "This is an error message using monad-logger."
```

When run, the `monad-logger` version similarly outputs an error message, but it's equipped with more context like timestamps or log levels, depending on the configuration:

```
[Error] This is an error message using monad-logger.
```

Both methods serve the purpose of writing to stderr, with the choice largely depending on your application's complexity and needs.
