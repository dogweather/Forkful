## What & Why?

Writing to a text file in Haskell is about programmatically creating or updating files with textual content. Programmers do this to persist data such as log messages, application output, or to store user-generated content, making it a fundamental task for applications that require data persistence or logging.

## How to:

Haskell's standard Prelude provides elementary support for writing to files using the `writeFile` and `appendFile` functions from the `System.IO` module. Here's a basic example of creating a new file (or overwriting an existing one) and then appending text to a file.

```haskell
import System.IO

-- Writing to a file, overwriting if it exists
main :: IO ()
main = do
  writeFile "example.txt" "This is line one.\n"
  appendFile "example.txt" "This is line two.\n"
```

When you run this program, it creates (or clears) `example.txt` and writes "This is line one." followed by "This is line two." on the next line.

For more advanced file handling, Haskell programmers often turn to the `text` package for efficient string processing and the `bytestring` package for handling binary data. Here's how to use the `text` package for file IO:

First, you need to add `text` to your project's dependencies. Then, you can use it as follows:

```haskell
import qualified Data.Text as T
import qualified Data.Text.IO as TIO

-- Writing to a file using the text package
main :: IO ()
main = do
  let content = T.pack "Using the text package for better performance.\n"
  TIO.writeFile "textExample.txt" content
  TIO.appendFile "textExample.txt" $ T.pack "Appending line two.\n"
```

In this snippet, `T.pack` converts a regular `String` to the `Text` type, which is more efficient. `TIO.writeFile` and `TIO.appendFile` are the `text` equivalents for writing and appending to files, respectively.

Running this code will result in a file named `textExample.txt` with two lines of text, demonstrating both creation and appending capabilities using the advanced `text` library for better performance and capability in handling Unicode text.
