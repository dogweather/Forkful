## What & Why?
Checking if a directory exists is a fundamental operation in many programming tasks, allowing for conditional actions based on the presence or absence of directory structures. It's crucial for file manipulation, automated scripts, and during the initial setup of software to ensure that necessary directories are in place, or to avoid duplicating directories.

## How to:
Haskell, through its base library, offers straightforward ways to check for directory existence, mainly using the `System.Directory` module. Let's look at a basic example:

```haskell
import System.Directory (doesDirectoryExist)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let dirPath = "/path/to/your/directory"
  exists <- doesDirectoryExist dirPath
  putStrLn $ "Does the directory exist? " ++ show exists
```

Sample output, depending on whether the directory exists:

```
Does the directory exist? True
```
Or:
```
Does the directory exist? False
```

For more complex scenarios or additional functionality, you might consider a popular third-party library like `filepath` for handling and manipulating file paths in a more abstract manner. However, for the purpose of simply checking if a directory exists, the base library's `System.Directory` is sufficient and efficient.

Remember, working with file systems can vary across platforms, and Haskell's approach aims to abstract away some of these differences. Always test your file operations on the target system to ensure expected behavior.
