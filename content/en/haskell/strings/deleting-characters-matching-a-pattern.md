## How to:
```haskell
import Data.List (isInfixOf)
import Data.Char (isSpace)

-- Simple function to remove a pattern from a string
removePattern :: Eq a => [a] -> [a] -> [a]
removePattern [] _ = []
removePattern string@(x:xs) pattern
  | pattern `isInfixOf` string = removePattern (drop (length pattern) string) pattern
  | otherwise = x : removePattern xs pattern

-- Use predefined functions to trim spaces from a string
trim :: String -> String
trim = f . f
   where f = reverse . dropWhile isSpace

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let text = "Haskell is super cool, super cool indeed."
  let cleanedText = removePattern text "super "
  putStrLn cleanedText  -- "Haskell is cool, cool indeed."
  putStrLn $ trim "   Trimmed whitespace   " -- "Trimmed whitespace"
```

## Deep Dive
Haskell's rich set of libraries, such as 'Data.List', provides various tools for manipulating lists, which strings are essentially a special case of. Historically, Haskell's pattern matching is a concept borrowed from older functional languages like ML.

There're different ways of pattern matching in Haskell. Our simple `removePattern` utilizes `isInfixOf` to check for the pattern. There're also regex libraries for complex patterns, but they add dependencies and sometimes overcomplicate things.

Speaking of dependencies, for trimming whitespaces, you could import a third-party library, but our 'trim' function does the job natively.

Lastly, performance-wise, always be cautious with recursive functions in Haskell; they can be inefficient if not properly optimized by the compiler. Thunks could pile up, causing space leaks. For better performance, you might explore Haskell's `Text` module for manipulation of large or numerous strings.
