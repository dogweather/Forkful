## What & Why?
String interpolation lets you embed variables directly in strings. It's done for convenience and readability—no plus signs or function calls needed to construct your message.

## How to:

In Haskell, string interpolation isn't baked in, but with the `interpolate` package, you can get pretty close. First, ensure you have the package:

```bash
cabal update
cabal install interpolate
```

Now, write some Haskell:

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE QuasiQuotes #-}
import Data.String.Interpolate (i)

main :: IO ()
main = do
    let name = "world"
    let greeting = [i|Hello, #{name}!|]
    putStrLn greeting
```

Run it:

```
Hello, world!
```

## Deep Dive

Historically, Haskell didn't come with string interpolation out of the box. It's a feature more common in scripting languages. Interpolation in Haskell became smoother with the development of quasiquoters, which allow you to define your own custom syntax—like our `i` for interpolating strings.

Alternatives? Sure, use `printf` from `Text.Printf`, or concatenate strings and variables with `++`. But these lack the elegance and simplicity of interpolation.

Implementation-wise, `interpolate` transforms your interpolated strings into regular Haskell strings at compile-time using Template Haskell, so there's no performance hit when running your code. It's clever and clean, just like Haskell.
