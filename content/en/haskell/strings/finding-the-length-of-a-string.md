## What & Why?

Finding the length of a string in Haskell is about determining how many characters it contains. Programmers often need this to control loop iterators, validate input, size allocations, or for debugging purposes.

## How to:

```Haskell
-- Using the `length` function
main = do
    let myString = "Hello, Haskell!"
    print $ length myString
```

Sample Output:
```
15
```

## Deep Dive

Haskell is a purely functional language where strings are represented as lists of characters. The `length` function, part of the Prelude (the default library imported into every Haskell program), operates under this representation.

Historically, strings as lists were a natural choice for Haskell due to their simplicity and the fact Lisp made a similar design choice (and influenced many functional languages). The `length` function just counts the elements in this list.

However, `length` is O(n), meaning the function will take time proportional to the length of the string. This isn't an issue for short strings, but for long ones, it can be inefficient.

Alternatives include:
- Using `Text` from the `text` package, a more efficient structure for Unicode text.
- Utilizing `ByteString` from the `bytestring` package for binary or ASCII data.

Both offer a `length` function optimized for their respective data structures.

Implementation wise, a basic version of the `length` function could look like this:

```Haskell
myLength :: [a] -> Int
myLength [] = 0          -- The length of an empty list is 0
myLength (_:xs) = 1 + myLength xs  -- Recursively add 1 for the rest of the list
```

For `Text` and `ByteString` data types, they have their own internal implementation details that make them more efficient than a simple linked list of characters.
