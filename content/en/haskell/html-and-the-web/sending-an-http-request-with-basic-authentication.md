## What & Why?
Sending an HTTP request with basic authentication means your program knocks on a web service's door, passing a username and password for entry. Programmers do it to access APIs that are off-limits to the general public or to perform actions on behalf of a user.

## How to:
You’ll need the `http-conduit` package for HTTP actions and `base64-bytestring` for encoding credentials. Import them and use `applyBasicAuth` to add credentials to your request.

```Haskell
import Network.HTTP.Simple
import Data.ByteString.Char8 (pack)
import Data.ByteString.Base64 (encode)

-- Construct basic auth header
let username = "user"
let password = "pass"
let auth = encode $ pack (username ++ ":" ++ password)

-- Create your request
request' = parseRequest_ "GET http://example.com/secret"
let request = setRequestHeader "Authorization" ["Basic " <> auth] request'

-- Perform the request
response <- httpLBS request

-- Handle the response
print $ getResponseBody response
```

This will output the API response, if your credentials check out.

## Deep Dive
Basic auth is ancient in web years, designed in the early '90s, and it's as simple as it gets: base64 encoded `username:password` sent in a header. It lacks fancy features like token expiration and, being unencrypted, should always be used over HTTPS.

Alternatives like OAuth provide more secure, granular control. For Haskell, libraries like `http-client` and `wreq` give you more options and flexibility.

Implementation-wise, remember not to hardcode credentials! Use environment variables or a secure vault in production. And since `base64` encoding isn't encryption (anyone can decode it), HTTPS isn't just a good idea, it’s a must.
