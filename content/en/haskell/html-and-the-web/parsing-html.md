## What & Why?

Parsing HTML in Haskell allows you to extract data, manipulate HTML content, or interact with web pages programmatically. This operation is essential for tasks such as web scraping, automated testing of web applications, and data mining from websites - leveraging Haskell's strong type system and functional programming paradigms to ensure robust and concise code.

## How to:

For parsing HTML in Haskell, we'll use the `tagsoup` library for its simplicity and flexibility. First, make sure to install the library by adding `tagsoup` to your project's cabal file or by running `cabal install tagsoup`. 

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}

import Text.HTML.TagSoup

-- Sample HTML for demonstration
let sampleHtml = "<html><body><p>Learn Haskell!</p><a href='http://example.com'>Click Here</a></body></html>"

-- Parse HTML and filter for links (a tags)
let tags = parseTags sampleHtml
let links = [fromAttrib "href" tag | tag <- tags, isTagOpenName "a" tag]

-- Print extracted links
print links
```

Sample output:
```plaintext
["http://example.com"]
```

For more sophisticated HTML parsing needs, consider using the `pandoc` library, especially if you're working with document conversion. It's exceptionally versatile but comes with more complexity:

```haskell
import Text.Pandoc

-- Assuming you have a Pandoc document (doc) loaded, e.g., from reading a file
let doc = ... -- Your Pandoc document goes here

-- Convert the document to HTML string
let htmlString = writeHtmlString def doc

-- Now, you would parse `htmlString` as above or proceed as per your requirements.
```
Keep in mind that `pandoc` is a much larger library focusing on conversion between numerous markup formats, so use it if you need those extra capabilities or if you're already dealing with document formats in your application.
