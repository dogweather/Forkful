## How to:
For parsing HTML in Haskell, we'll use the `tagsoup` library for its simplicity and flexibility. First, make sure to install the library by adding `tagsoup` to your project's cabal file or by running `cabal install tagsoup`. 

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}

import Text.HTML.TagSoup

-- Sample HTML for demonstration
let sampleHtml = "<html><body><p>Learn Haskell!</p><a href='http://example.com'>Click Here</a></body></html>"

-- Parse HTML and filter for links (a tags)
let tags = parseTags sampleHtml
let links = [fromAttrib "href" tag | tag <- tags, isTagOpenName "a" tag]

-- Print extracted links
print links
```

Sample output:
```plaintext
["http://example.com"]
```

For more sophisticated HTML parsing needs, consider using the `pandoc` library, especially if you're working with document conversion. It's exceptionally versatile but comes with more complexity:

```haskell
import Text.Pandoc

-- Assuming you have a Pandoc document (doc) loaded, e.g., from reading a file
let doc = ... -- Your Pandoc document goes here

-- Convert the document to HTML string
let htmlString = writeHtmlString def doc

-- Now, you would parse `htmlString` as above or proceed as per your requirements.
```
Keep in mind that `pandoc` is a much larger library focusing on conversion between numerous markup formats, so use it if you need those extra capabilities or if you're already dealing with document formats in your application.
