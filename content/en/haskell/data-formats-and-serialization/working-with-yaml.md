## How to:
Haskell does not have built-in support for YAML processing, but you can use third-party libraries such as `yaml` and `aeson` for parsing and generating YAML data. Here's how you can get started:

### Reading YAML
First, add the `yaml` package to your project's dependencies. Then, you can use the following example to parse a simple YAML document:

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}

import Data.YAML
import Data.ByteString (ByteString)
import Control.Monad.IO.Class (liftIO)

-- Example YAML data
yamlData :: ByteString
yamlData = "
name: John Doe
age: 30
"

-- Define a data structure that matches the YAML document
data Person = Person
  { name :: String
  , age :: Int
  } deriving (Show)

instance FromYAML Person where
  parseYAML = withMap "Person" $ \m -> Person
    <$> m .: "name"
    <*> m .: "age"

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let parsed = decode1 yamlData :: Either (Pos,String) Person
  case parsed of
    Left err -> putStrLn $ "Error parsing YAML: " ++ show err
    Right person -> print person
```
Sample output for the above code might look like:
```
Person {name = "John Doe", age = 30}
```

### Writing YAML
To generate YAML from Haskell data structures, you can use the `yaml` package's encoding functionalities as shown below:

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}

import Data.YAML
import Data.ByteString.Lazy.Char8 (unpack)

-- Using the Person data structure from the previous example

person :: Person
person = Person "Jane Doe" 25

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let yamlData = encode1 person
  putStrLn $ unpack yamlData
```
The output of this program will be a YAML-formatted string:
```
name: Jane Doe
age: 25
```

These examples should serve as a starting point for working with YAML in Haskell. Depending on your needs, you might want to explore more advanced features and options provided by these libraries.
