## What & Why?

YAML, short for "YAML Ain't Markup Language", is a human-friendly data serialization standard that can be used for all programming languages. Programmers often utilize YAML in configuration files and data exchange between languages due to its readability and straightforward structure.

## How to:

Haskell does not have built-in support for YAML processing, but you can use third-party libraries such as `yaml` and `aeson` for parsing and generating YAML data. Here's how you can get started:

### Reading YAML
First, add the `yaml` package to your project's dependencies. Then, you can use the following example to parse a simple YAML document:

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}

import Data.YAML
import Data.ByteString (ByteString)
import Control.Monad.IO.Class (liftIO)

-- Example YAML data
yamlData :: ByteString
yamlData = "
name: John Doe
age: 30
"

-- Define a data structure that matches the YAML document
data Person = Person
  { name :: String
  , age :: Int
  } deriving (Show)

instance FromYAML Person where
  parseYAML = withMap "Person" $ \m -> Person
    <$> m .: "name"
    <*> m .: "age"

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let parsed = decode1 yamlData :: Either (Pos,String) Person
  case parsed of
    Left err -> putStrLn $ "Error parsing YAML: " ++ show err
    Right person -> print person
```
Sample output for the above code might look like:
```
Person {name = "John Doe", age = 30}
```

### Writing YAML
To generate YAML from Haskell data structures, you can use the `yaml` package's encoding functionalities as shown below:

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}

import Data.YAML
import Data.ByteString.Lazy.Char8 (unpack)

-- Using the Person data structure from the previous example

person :: Person
person = Person "Jane Doe" 25

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let yamlData = encode1 person
  putStrLn $ unpack yamlData
```
The output of this program will be a YAML-formatted string:
```
name: Jane Doe
age: 25
```

These examples should serve as a starting point for working with YAML in Haskell. Depending on your needs, you might want to explore more advanced features and options provided by these libraries.
