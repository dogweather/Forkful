## What & Why?
Refactoring is the process of tweaking your code without changing its external behavior. It's all about cleaning up and organizing your act to make the code easier to read, maintain, and extend. It can also help squash bugs and improve performance.

## How to:
Let's say you've got a chunk of Haskell code that's repeating itself more than your favorite song. Here's a quick look at how you might refactor that using functions.

Before refactoring:

```haskell
printInvoice :: String -> Float -> String -> IO ()
printInvoice customer total item = do
  putStrLn $ "Customer: " ++ customer
  putStrLn $ "Total: " ++ show total
  putStrLn $ "Item: " ++ item
```

After a bit of refactoring:

```haskell
printDetail :: String -> String -> IO ()
printDetail label value = putStrLn $ label ++ ": " ++ value

printInvoice :: String -> Float -> String -> IO ()
printInvoice customer total item = do
  printDetail "Customer" customer
  printDetail "Total" (show total)
  printDetail "Item" item

-- Sample output:
-- Customer: Alice
-- Total: $42.00
-- Item: Haskell Programming Guide
```

As you can see, by extracting the common pattern into a separate `printDetail` function, we avoid repetition and make `printInvoice` clearer and easier to manage.

## Deep Dive
When Haskell hit the scene in the late '80s, it was clear that the functional paradigm could bring some fresh air to coding practices. Fast forward, and refactoring in Haskell is particularly elegant thanks to functions being first-class citizens and its strong static type system. You refactor without fearing that you'd break your app since the compiler's got your back.

Alternatives to manual refactoring may include using automated tools, though the functional nature and type safety of Haskell can sometimes make this less prevalent compared to other languages. Implementation-wise, it's important to leverage Haskell's features such as higher-order functions, purity, and immutability to make refactoring smoother.

Refactorings like "Extract Function", just showcased, are common, but you can also do "Inline Function", "Rename Variable", and "Change Function Signature" with confidence, thanks to the type system. Haskell's powerful type inference can sometimes catch errors that would slip through in other languages.
