## How to:
Haskell handles errors robustly through types like `Maybe` and `Either`. Here's a quick look:

```Haskell
safeDivide :: Integral a => a -> a -> Maybe a
safeDivide _ 0 = Nothing  -- Dividing by zero is a no-go, so we return Nothing.
safeDivide x y = Just (x `div` y)  -- Otherwise, we're all good, return the result in a Just.

-- Let's see it in action:
example1 :: Maybe Int
example1 = safeDivide 10 2  -- Just 5

example2 :: Maybe Int
example2 = safeDivide 10 0  -- Nothing
```

For more complex error handling, `Either` comes into play:

```Haskell
safeDivideEither :: Integral a => a -> a -> Either String a
safeDivideEither _ 0 = Left "Divide by zero error."  -- This time, the error carries a message.
safeDivideEither x y = Right (x `div` y)

-- And in use:
example3 :: Either String Int
example3 = safeDivideEither 10 2  -- Right 5

example4 :: Either String Int
example4 = safeDivideEither 10 0  -- Left "Divide by zero error."
```

## Deep Dive
In the Haskell world, error handling has a strong history. Back in the day, errors could bring your whole program down—no fun. Haskell's type system offers ways to make this a lot less likely. We've got `Maybe` and `Either`, but there are others like `Exceptions` and `IO` for different scenarios.

`Maybe` is simple: you get `Just` something if all's well, or `Nothing` if it's not. `Either` steps it up, allowing you to return an error message (`Left`) or a successful result (`Right`).

Both are pure, meaning they don't mess with the outside world – a big deal in Haskell. We avoid the pitfalls of unchecked exceptions that plague some other languages.

For those not content with `Maybe` and `Either`, libraries like `Control.Exception` provide more traditional, imperative-style error handling through exceptions. But using them too liberally can complicate things, so the community often sticks to the types.
