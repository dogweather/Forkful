## What & Why?
Removing quotes from a string in PHP means stripping out those pesky double (`"`) or single (`'`) quote characters that can mess with your code logic or database queries. Programmers do it to clean or sanitize input data, ensuring that strings are safely used or stored.

## How to:
Here's a straightforward example using PHP's built-in functions:

```php
$quotedString = "'Hello,' she said, \"It's a fine day!\"";
$unquotedString = str_replace(array("'", "\""), '', $quotedString);
echo $unquotedString; // Outputs: Hello, she said, Its a fine day!
```

Simple, right? This `str_replace()` function takes an array of characters to remove from the string, including both single and double quotes.

## Deep Dive
Back in the early days of PHP, developers had to be extra cautious with quotes in strings, especially when inserting data into a database. Improperly handled quotes could lead to SQL injection attacks. Enter magic quotes, a feature that auto-escaped input data. It became deprecated and was finally removed because it encouraged bad coding practices and security issues.

Now, we use functions like `str_replace()` or regex with `preg_replace()` for more advanced patterns. Here's a regex example:

```php
$quotedString = "'Hello,' she said, \"It's a fine day!\"";
$unquotedString = preg_replace('/[\'"]/', '', $quotedString);
echo $unquotedString;
```

For JSON data, you might use `json_encode()` with options like `JSON_UNESCAPED_SLASHES | JSON_UNESCAPED_UNICODE` to avoid extra backslashes in your quotes.

When implementing, consider edge cases. What if your string is meant to have certain quotes, like dialogue in a story or inches in measurements? Context matters, so tailor your quote-stripping to the data's intended use.
