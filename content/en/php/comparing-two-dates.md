## What & Why?
Comparing two dates means checking if they're the same, or finding out which one is earlier or later. Programmers do it to handle scheduling, event sequencing, or time-sensitive operations like session timeouts or subscription expiries.

## How to:
PHP's `DateTime` objects and comparison operators make this simple. Here's a straightforward example:

```PHP
<?php
$date1 = new DateTime("2023-04-01");
$date2 = new DateTime("2023-04-15");

// Check if dates are the same
if ($date1 == $date2) {
    echo "Dates are the same.\n";
} else {
    echo "Dates are different.\n";
}

// Check if one date is before the other
if ($date1 < $date2) {
    echo "Date1 is earlier than Date2.\n";
} else {
    echo "Date1 is later than or equal to Date2.\n";
}
?>
```

Sample output:

```
Dates are different.
Date1 is earlier than Date2.
```

## Deep Dive:
Comparing dates is as old as programming itself. In early computing, dates were often compared using strings or timestamps. PHP evolved to offer `DateTime` objects, which provide a more intuitive way to handle date and time.

There are other methods to compare dates:
- `DateTime::diff()` to get a `DateInterval` object representing the difference between two dates.
- Convert dates to timestamps using `strtotime()` and compare them as integers.

It's crucial to consider time zones when comparing dates. `DateTime` objects can (and should) include time zone information to ensure accuracy across different locales.
