## What & Why?

Random numbers are numbers produced by a process whose outcome is unpredictable. Programmers generate such numbers for applications like simulations, cryptography, games, or for testing algorithms.

## How to:

To generate a random number in PHP, you'd use the `rand()` or `mt_rand()` functions. For instance:

```PHP
<?php
// Generate a random number between 1 and 10
$randomNumber = rand(1, 10);
echo $randomNumber;
?>
```

Looking a bit unpredictable, isn't it? Let's not stop there; let's use `mt_rand()`:

```PHP
<?php
// Generate a number between 20 and 50
$randomNumber = mt_rand(20, 50);
echo $randomNumber;
?>
```

`mt_rand()` works similar to `rand()`, but it's a bit faster and produces a better random value.

## Deep Dive

Initially in PHP, only `rand()` was available. But it was found that its algorithm has statistical issues and produces numbers that aren't evenly distributed. Enter Mersenne Twister's `mt_rand()`, a better pseudo-random number generator that brings better uniformity. 

For most ordinary purposes, like games or randomized content, `rand()` and `mt_rand()` will do. However, these are not cryptographically secure. For something truly random, such as generating cryptographic salts or keys, you'd use PHPâ€™s `random_int()` or `random_bytes()` functions. 

```PHP
<?php
  // Generate a cryptographically secure random integer between 1 and 100
  $randomInt = random_int(1, 100); 
  echo $randomInt;
?>
```

This function gets us as close to true randomness as feasible.
