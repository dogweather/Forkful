## What & Why?

Generating random numbers in PHP involves creating numbers that are unpredictable and lack any sort of pattern. Programmers often use random numbers for tasks such as generating unique user IDs, security tokens, or for simulating real-life scenarios in games and simulations.

## How to:

In PHP, you can generate random numbers using various functions, but the most common are `rand()`, `mt_rand()`, and `random_int()`.

1. **Using `rand()`**:

   This function generates a pseudorandom integer. You can specify a range by providing the minimum and maximum values.

   ```PHP
   echo rand(); // Generates a random number 
   echo rand(1, 10); // Generates a random number between 1 and 10
   
   // Sample output: 456
   //                 3
   ```

2. **Using `mt_rand()`**:

   An improvement over `rand()` in terms of speed and randomness. It also allows specifying a range.

   ```PHP
   echo mt_rand(); // Generates a random number
   echo mt_rand(1, 50); // Generates a random number between 1 and 50
   
   // Sample output: 24234
   //                 17
   ```

3. **Using `random_int()`**:

   This function is considered more cryptographically secure compared to `rand()` and `mt_rand()`. It generates cryptographically secure pseudo-random integers within a given range.

   ```PHP
   echo random_int(1, 100); // Generates a secure random number between 1 and 100
   
   // Sample output: 29
   ```

**Note**: Always prefer `random_int()` for security-critical applications such as token generation since it offers better randomness.

## Deep Dive

PHP's approach to generating random numbers has evolved significantly over the years, primarily driven by the need for more secure and efficient algorithms. Initially, `rand()` was widely used until `mt_rand()`, based on the Mersenne Twister algorithm, came along offering better speed and randomness for most applications. However, neither of these functions are suitable for cryptographic purposes due to their predictability.

Enter `random_int()`, introduced in PHP 7, which generates cryptographically secure pseudo-random integers using sources of randomness provided by the operating system. This function is compliant with current best practices for security and addresses the limitations of its predecessors. 

While `rand()` and `mt_rand()` still have their uses in less security-sensitive contexts, their implementations rely on algorithms that don't guarantee cryptographic security. Hence, when developing applications where security is a concern, or where an unpredictable outcome is crucial, `random_int()` should be the go-to choice.

In addition to generating numbers, generating random bytes for encryption keys or other secure elements can be achieved using `random_bytes()`, complementing `random_int()` in PHP's suite of cryptographic tools. 

As technology advances and the importance of security in software development increases, the role of secure random number generation only grows. PHP's evolution reflects a broader move towards safer and more reliable cryptographic practices in programming languages.
