## How to:
PHP provides built-in functions for handling CSV files, making it straightforward to read from and write to these files without needing third-party libraries. Here are examples to get you started:

### Reading a CSV File
You can open a CSV file and read its contents using `fopen()` in combination with `fgetcsv()`:

```php
<?php
$filename = 'data.csv';
$handle = fopen($filename, "r");
if ($handle !== FALSE) {
    while (($data = fgetcsv($handle, 1000, ",")) !== FALSE) {
        $num = count($data);
        echo "Number of fields in line: $num\n";
        for ($c = 0; $c < $num; $c++) {
            echo $data[$c] . "\n";
        }
    }
    fclose($handle);
}
?>
```

This script prints each line's number of fields followed by the content of each field.

### Writing to a CSV File
To write to a CSV file, use `fopen()` in write mode (`w`) and `fputcsv()`:

```php
<?php
$list = [
    ['ID', 'Name', 'Email'],
    [1, 'John Doe', 'john@example.com'],
    [2, 'Jane Doe', 'jane@example.com']
];

$handle = fopen('users.csv', 'w');

foreach ($list as $row) {
    fputcsv($handle, $row);
}

fclose($handle);
?>
```

This script creates a file named `users.csv` and writes the header and two rows of data to it.

### Using a Library: League\Csv
For more advanced CSV handling, the `League\Csv` library offers a robust set of features. After installing it via Composer (`composer require league/csv`), you can use it to read and write CSV data more flexibly.

#### Reading with League\Csv
```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use League\Csv\Reader;

$csv = Reader::createFromPath('data.csv', 'r');
$csv->setHeaderOffset(0); // Set if you want to use the first row as header

$results = $csv->getRecords();
foreach ($results as $row) {
    print_r($row);
}
?>
```

This script reads `data.csv`, treating the first row as column headers and prints each row as an associative array.

#### Writing with League\Csv
```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use League\Csv\Writer;

$csv = Writer::createFromPath('users_new.csv', 'w+');

$csv->insertOne(['ID', 'Name', 'Email']);
$csv->insertAll([
    [3, 'Alex Doe', 'alex@example.com'],
    [4, 'Anna Smith', 'anna@example.com']
]);

echo "Written to users_new.csv successfully.";
?>
```

This creates `users_new.csv` and writes a header row followed by two data rows.
