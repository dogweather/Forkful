## What & Why?
String interpolation is a way to embed variables within a string. Why bother? It makes your PHP code neater and more readable by avoiding excessive concatenation.

## How to: 
Let's get straight to coding. In PHP, you can do string interpolation using double quotes or the heredoc syntax. Here's a simple example to show you both:

```PHP
//Using double quotes
$name = "Fizzy";
echo "Hello, $name! How are you?";

//Using Heredoc syntax
$message = <<<MSG
Hello, $name! How have you been?
MSG;
echo $message;
```

Run these, and both will output:

```
Hello, Fizzy! How are you?
Hello, Fizzy! How have you been?
```

Check how we inserted `$name` directly into the strings. No concatenation. Easy-peasy!

## Deep Dive
Python and Perl inspired PHP's string interpolation feature. It showed up in PHP 4 (2000) and is better than concatenation because itâ€™s more efficient at runtime.

Your alternatives are string concatenation or using template engines like Twig or Smarty. For simple needs, stick to interpolation or concatenation. Else, consider a template engine.

Remember: only double-quoted strings and heredoc strings can interpolate variables. Single-quoted strings? Nope, they'll read your variables as plain text.
