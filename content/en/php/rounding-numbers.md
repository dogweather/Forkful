## What & Why?
Rounding numbers means chopping off the decimals to a set precision, often to whole numbers. Programmers round to simplify calculations, improve performance, or make outputs user-friendly.

## How to:
PHP offers a few ways to round numbers: `round()`, `ceil()`, and `floor()`. Here's how they work:

```php
echo round(3.14159);   // Returns 3
echo round(3.14159, 2); // Returns 3.14

echo ceil(3.14159);    // Returns 4, always rounds up

echo floor(3.14159);   // Returns 3, always rounds down
```

## Deep Dive
Rounding numbers has been essential in math and computation since ancient times to deal with impractical infinite decimals. In PHP, `round()` can take a precision parameter and mode, affecting its behavior â€“ `PHP_ROUND_HALF_UP`, `PHP_ROUND_HALF_DOWN`, etc., define how it'll behave when it meets a ".5" scenario. Precision is key in financial applications where rounding might be legally regulated, affecting how `round()` gets implemented in code.

Alternatives to built-in functions include custom rounding methods or BC Math functions for arbitrary precision arithmetic, which are useful for scenarios needing more control or dealing with very large numbers where native accuracy might falter.
