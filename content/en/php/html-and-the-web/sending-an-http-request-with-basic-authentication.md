## How to:
Here's the simple way to send an HTTP request with basic authentication using cURL in PHP:

```PHP
<?php
$url = 'https://api.example.com/data';
$username = 'your_username';
$password = 'your_password';

$ch = curl_init($url);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH, CURLAUTH_BASIC);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_USERPWD, "$username:$password");
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);

$response = curl_exec($ch);
curl_close($ch);

echo $response;
?>
```

Sample output:

``` 
{
  "authenticated": true,
  "data": "Some secure data"
}
```

## Deep Dive
HTTP Basic Authentication has been in use since the early days of the web. It's not the most secure option around (as credentials are sent in base64 encoding, which is easily decoded), but it's straightforward to implement for quick-and-dirty access control.

Suppose security is a concern (and it should be), you’d turn to more robust methods like OAuth, JWT or API keys. Yet, basic auth persists partly due to legacy systems and partly for internal systems where you control access tightly.

In PHP, cURL is widely used for making HTTP requests, but alternatives like `file_get_contents` or Guzzle (a PHP HTTP client) exist. When using `file_get_contents`, a context with the appropriate header must be created:

```PHP
<?php
$context = stream_context_create([
    'http' => [
        'header' => "Authorization: Basic " . base64_encode("$username:$password")
    ]
]);

$response = file_get_contents($url, false, $context);

echo $response;
?>
```

Picking the right tool comes down to your project’s needs and the level of control and functionality you desire.
