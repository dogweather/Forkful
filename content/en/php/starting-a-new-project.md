## What & Why?

Starting a new project is cracking open that digital egg of potential and getting down to coding something fresh. Programmers jump into new projects to solve problems, explore ideas, or build the next cool tool that might make life a bit easier or more fun.

## How To:

Say you're kicking things off with a basic 'Hello World'. It's cliché but it's also tradition – like a coder's handshake. Here's how you'd do it in PHP:

```php
<?php
echo "Hello, World!";
?>
```

Run that, and your output is:

```
Hello, World!
```

But what if you're past the pleasantries? Let's set up a simple project. 

1. Install Composer - it's the backbone of modern PHP development. Hit up getcomposer.org.
2. Run `composer init` and follow the prompts to create your `composer.json`.
3. Use Composer to require some packages. For a quick example, let’s grab Monolog for logging:

```php
composer require monolog/monolog
```

Initialize your project structure:
```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Monolog\Logger;
use Monolog\Handler\StreamHandler;

// Create a log channel
$log = new Logger('name');
$log->pushHandler(new StreamHandler('path/to/your.log', Logger::WARNING));

// Add records to the log
$log->warning('Fool of a Took!');
$log->error('They have a cave troll!');
?>
```

Suddenly, you've got the beginnings of a proper project!

## Deep Dive:

PHP has been around since 1995, evolving from a simple scripting language to a powerful tool for web development. Composer, a dependency manager introduced in 2012, transformed the PHP ecosystem by simplifying package management and enabling modern, modular development practices.

Alternatives? Sure. If you're not a fan of Composer, you might look at PEAR, but it's like choosing a horse and buggy over a Tesla—charming but not as efficient.

As for implementation, a standard project would use namespacing, follow the PSR standards for code style and autoloading, and likely be built on a framework such as Laravel or Symfony, which come with their own project initiation commands like `laravel new` or `symfony new`.
