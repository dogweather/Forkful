## What & Why?

Starting a new project in PHP presents a blank canvas to computer programmers, a chance for them to tactfully design and build a software solution from ground up. Itâ€™s a journey embarked upon for numerous reasons; solving complex problems, creating new features, or even launching new apps. 

## How To:

Starting a project is all about laying the groundwork. Here's a simple example of setting up a new project with a "Hello, World!" program:

```PHP
<?php
  echo "Hello, World!";
?>
```

To see it in action, save this in a file named `index.php` and visit that with a web server - you'll see "Hello, World!" printed on the webpage.

## Deep Dive

Historically, PHP was primarily used for creating dynamic web content. Over time, it evolved beyond this and found its place in complex enterprise applications.

When starting a new project, PHP isn't the unique option, alternatives like JavaScript (Node.js), Python, and Ruby also offer excellent environments for web development. Decision on the language depends on the project requirements, resources, and team expertise.

Setting up a PHP project involves a few more details:

- **Setting up a development environment**: For a smooth experience, use a pre-packaged stack like XAMPP or WAMP, which includes PHP, MySQL and Apache. This will allow you to run your PHP applications locally.

- **Directory Structure**: Organize your applications into folders like 'assets' for images/css/js, 'includes' for PHP helper files, 'pages' for individual web pages.

With PHP7 and higher, developers can make use of numerous enhancements including type declarations and error handling improvements. This, contrasted to PHP 5, offers significantly improved performance and greater security.
