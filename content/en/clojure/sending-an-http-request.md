## What & Why?
Sending an HTTP request is like asking a website server for specific information or data. Programmers do it to interact with web APIs, fetch data from a database, or post user form data, among other things.

## How to:
In Clojure, the 'clj-http.client' library is our go-to. If it's not in your project, add it to the project.clj dependencies:
```Clojure
[clj-http "3.12.3"]
```
For the 'GET' request, we'll use this example:
```Clojure
(require '[clj-http.client :as client])

(let [response (client/get "http://example.com" 
                           {:headers {"Accept" "application/json"}})]
  (println (:status response))
  (println (:body response)))
```
This will print the HTTP status code and the response body.

The 'POST' request is similar but with an added payload:
```Clojure
(let [response (client/post "http://example.com" 
                            {:body "my data" 
                             :content-type :json})]
  (println (:status response))
  (println (:body response)))
```
This will post "my data" to the server and print the resulting response.

## Deep Dive
As said, we're using the Clj-http library, which emerged around 2011. One of the most loved aspects of this library is its simplicity in making HTTP requests. Logged requests and responses also makes debugging a breeze.

As for alternatives, you might look into 'http-kit' if you need a full-stack HTTP client/server. However, 'clj-http' is generally more beginner-friendly.

In giving you status codes and headers, among other fields, 'clj-http' thinly maps over Java's Apache HttpClient. Features sometimes depend on this underlying implementation.
