## What & Why?

Parsing HTML is the act of turning a string of HTML into a data structure your program can understand and manipulate. Programmers do it to interact with, extract, and modify content from the web.

## How to:

To parse HTML in Clojure, we use the `clj-tagsoup` library, a wrapper for the Tagsoup Java library which is handy for parsing real-world HTML.

First, add the clj-tagsoup dependency to your project:

```clojure
[clj-tagsoup "0.3.3"] ; Check for the latest version
```

Now, let's parse some HTML:

```clojure
(require '[clj-tagsoup.core :as tagsoup])

; Parse HTML and get a vector of maps representing the parsed elements
(def parsed-html (tagsoup/parse-string "<html><body><p>Hello, World!</p></body></html>"))

; Access elements
(println (first parsed-html))
```

Sample output:

```clojure
{:tag :html, :attrs {}, :content [...]}
```

To extract specific elements, like paragraphs:

```clojure
(defn extract-paragraphs [html]
  (let [parsed (tagsoup/parse-string html)]
    (filter #(= :p (:tag %)) parsed)))

; Usage
(extract-paragraphs "<p>First</p><p>Second</p>")
```

## Deep Dive

Parsing HTML in Clojure, as with other languages, typically involves navigating a tree-like structure. Back in the day, this could get messy. Libraries like Tagsoup made life easier by handling quirky real-world HTML.

Clojureâ€™s functional nature lets us manipulate HTML data smoothly. Libraries like `clj-tagsoup` leverage Java's battle-tested tools while adding Clojure's elegance.

Alternative libraries include `Enlive` and `Hickory`. Enlive specializes in both parsing and templating, allowing more complex operations. Hickory translates HTML to Clojure data structures for those who prefer a pure Clojure solution.

The implementation focuses on ease and a declarative style. Under the hood, `clj-tagsoup` uses locators and navigators to traverse HTML, providing a higher abstraction over direct DOM manipulation.
