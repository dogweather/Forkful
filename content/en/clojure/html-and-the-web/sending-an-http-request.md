## How to:
In Clojure, you can send HTTP requests using the `clj-http` client.

First, add the dependency to your `project.clj`:
```clojure
[clj-http "3.12.3"]
```

Now, let's send a GET request:
```clojure
(require '[clj-http.client :as client])

(let [response (client/get "http://httpbin.org/get")]
  (println response))
```

Output sample:
```clojure
{:status 200, :headers {...}, :body "..."}
```

To post data:
```clojure
(let [response (client/post "http://httpbin.org/post" {:form-params {:key "value"}})]
  (println response))
```

## Deep Dive
Sending HTTP requests isn't new. It's as old as the web itself. Clojure, being a modern Lisp, has several libs to make HTTP requests. `clj-http` is a popular one, but others like `http-kit` or Clojure's core `clj-http.client` exist.

`clj-http` leans on the Apache HttpComponents Client for Java under the hood. It's versatile but can feel Java-heavy. An alternative, `http-kit`, is more lightweight and Clojure-idiomatic but less feature-rich.

When you send HTTP requests, you're doing so over TCP/IP, which frames your requests according to a well-established protocol. This universal standard lets you interact with practically any web service out there.
