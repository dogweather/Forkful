## What & Why?
Creating a temporary file is the process of making a short-lived file for intermediate data storage. Programmers use them for things like caching, data processing, or when it's better not to clutter permanent storage.

## How to:
Clojure makes it simple. The `clojure.java.io` library has your back.

```Clojure
(require '[clojure.java.io :as io])

; Create a temp file
(def temp-file (io/file (io/create-temp-file "prefix-" ".txt")))

; Use the temp file
(spit temp-file "Temporary data is temporary")

; Check contents
(println (slurp temp-file)) ; => "Temporary data is temporary"

; Clean up by deleting the temp file when you're done
(.delete temp-file)
```

Nothing sticks forever. Our temporary data now rests in peace.

## Deep Dive
The notion of temporary files has been around since the early days of computing, mainly to avoid using up limited primary storage. It's like digital rent-a-space.

Clojure leans on Java's shoulders here, using Java's `File` class capabilities. While you could dive into the Java jungle directly, Clojure wraps it up neatly.

Alternatives? You bet. Temp directories are a thing. But that's another story, and Clojure has got that covered too (enter `create-temp-dir`).

Why not just use memory? Well, temp files are perfect for handling data too big for RAM or when you'd like a physical file without worrying about long-term storage or cleanup.
