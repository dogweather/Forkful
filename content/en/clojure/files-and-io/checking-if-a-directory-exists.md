## What & Why?
Checking if a directory exists in Clojure involves verifying the presence of a file system directory from within your Clojure application. This task is crucial for file operations, to prevent errors when reading from or writing to directories that may not be there, ensuring robust and error-free code execution.

## How to:
Clojure, being a JVM language, can utilize Java's `java.io.File` class for this purpose. You don't need any third-party library for such a basic operation. Here's how you can do it:

```clojure
(import 'java.io.File)

(defn directory-exists? [dir-path]
  (let [dir (File. dir-path)]
    (.exists dir)))

;; Usage example
(println (directory-exists? "/path/to/your/directory")) ;; true or false
```

This function, `directory-exists?`, takes a directory path as a string and returns `true` if the directory exists and `false` otherwise. This is achieved by creating a `File` object with the directory path and then calling the `.exists` method on this object.

In addition to raw Java interop, you can use Clojure libraries that abstract away some of the Java boilerplate. One such library is `clojure.java.io`. However, for checking if a directory exists, you would still use the `File` class, but you might find the library useful for other file operations. Example:

```clojure
(require '[clojure.java.io :as io])

(defn directory-exists?-clojure [dir-path]
  (.exists (io/file dir-path)))

;; Example usage
(println (directory-exists?-clojure "/another/path/to/check")) ;; true or false
```

This version is quite similar but uses the Clojure `io/file` function to create the `File` object. This method blends more naturally into Clojure codebases by leveraging Clojure's library for IO operations, rather than directly interfacing with Java classes.
