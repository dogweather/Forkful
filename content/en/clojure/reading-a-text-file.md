## What & Why?

Reading a text file means fetching data in a type of human-readable format. Programmers do it to retrieve content, whether it's configuration data, input data for processing, or simply to analyze logs.

## How to:

Reading a text file in Clojure is straightforward. Let's use the `slurp` function:

```Clojure
(defn read-file [file-path]
  (slurp file-path))
```

Call the function with the file path:

```Clojure
(read-file "/path/to/your/file.txt")
```

The output is a string containing the file's content:

```Clojure
"This is the content of your file."
```

## Deep Dive

`slurp` in Clojure handles the opening, reading, and closing of the file, making file I/O much simpler to manage. The `slurp` function has been there since Clojure 1.0 released in 2007 (conj.io/store/v1/org.clojure/clojure/1.0.0/clj/clojure.core/slurp).

If you want stream-oriented reading instead of reading the entire file, consider the `line-seq` function. This function lazily reads the file line by line, thus managing memory better for large files.

```Clojure
(with-open [rdr (clojure.java.io/reader "/path/to/your/file.txt")]
  (doseq [line (line-seq rdr)]
    (println line)))
```
