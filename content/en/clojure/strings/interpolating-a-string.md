## How to:
```Clojure
;; Basics with `str` and `format`
(def name "World")
(str "Hello, " name "!")  ; => "Hello, World!"

;; Using `format`, akin to printf-style formatting
(format "Goodbye, %s!" name)  ; => "Goodbye, World!"

;; Clojure doesn't have built-in string interpolation like other languages,
;; but we can get creative with `str` and `format`.
```

## Deep Dive:
Clojure's a bit of an ascetic: no built-in string interpolation. However, `str` and `format` are the go-to for dynamic strings. Origin story? Clojure’s simplicity ethos. It trusts we can handle string construction ourselves. 

For alternatives, enter the templating world: `clostache` (a Clojure implementation of Mustache) or `hiccup` for HTML contexts. They come handy when `str` and `format` feel too primitive.

Under the hood, `format` delegates to Java’s `String.format`, a fact that illustrates Clojure’s Java interoperability superpower. So, while you don't get the sugar, you’ve got the muscle of Java when you need it.
