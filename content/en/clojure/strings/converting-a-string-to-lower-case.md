## What & Why?
Converting a string to lower case means transforming all the characters in the text to their lower-case variants, such as turning "Hello, World!" into "hello, world!". Programmers do this for consistency, especially in tasks like comparing user input where case shouldn't matter.

## How to:
In Clojure, to convert a string to lower case, you'll use the `clojure.string/lower-case` function. Look how simple it is:

```clojure
(require '[clojure.string :as str])

(str/lower-case "Hello, World!") ; => "hello, world!"
```

Output is straightforward:

```clojure
"hello, world!"
```

## Deep Dive
Historically, case conversion has been around since early computing to harmonize text data processing. In Clojure, the `clojure.string/lower-case` function is part of the `clojure.string` library, a collection of utilities for string manipulation included in the core language.

Alternatives to `clojure.string/lower-case` include rolling your own function through mapping with `char` manipulation, but this is reinventing the wheel when you have a built-in function that's optimized and well-tested.

Internally, `clojure.string/lower-case` hands off the heavy lifting to Java's own `toLowerCase` method, since Clojure runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This ensures high performance as it leverages Java's mature libraries.
