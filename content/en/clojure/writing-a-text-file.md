## What & Why?

Writing a text file involves creating or altering text data and saving it to a file on your storage medium. Programmers do it for data logging, configuration settings, or exporting human-readable reports.

## How to:

In Clojure, you use the `spit` function to write data to a text file. It's straightforward:

```clojure
(spit "example.txt" "Hello, World! This is Clojure speaking.")
```

The `spit` function takes the filename and the content. To append content, set the `append` flag:

```clojure
(spit "example.txt" "\nLet's add this new line." :append true)
```

Sample output for `example.txt` after both operations:

```
Hello, World! This is Clojure speaking.
Let's add this new line.
```

## Deep Dive

Clojureâ€™s `spit` function comes from its "I/O" library - a successor to Lisp's legacy of concise file operations. Alternatives in Clojure include `clojure.java.io/writer` for buffered writing and libraries like `slurp` for reading files. When using `spit`, remember it's not meant for large streams of data due to potential memory issues - use `writer` and loop over the data instead.
