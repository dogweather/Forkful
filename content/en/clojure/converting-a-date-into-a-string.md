## What & Why?

Converting a date into a string means representing a date as a readable text. Programmers do this to enable user-friendly display of dates and enhance portability across different systems.

## How to:

Clojure provides the `clj-time` library to handle date-related operations. Suppose weâ€™re given a date-time object and we want to convert it into a string:

```clojure
(require '[clj-time.format :as f])

(def date (t/date-time 2020 1 1))

(defn date-to-string [date]
  (f/unparse 
    (f/formatter "dd-MM-yyyy") 
    date))
    
(println (date-to-string date)) ; "01-01-2020"
```

## Deep Dive

Historically, date-time manipulation in Clojure wasn't as simple, but with Java interop and libraries like `clj-time`, things have become easier. 

A key alternative to `clj-time` is the `java.time` package, introduced in Java 8, which has rich features and is recommended for use in newer Java projects. 

As for the implementation, `clj-time` offers `formatter` function to define date format and `unparse` function to convert the date into the desired format.

For instance, if you want the output in the "MM-dd-yyyy" format:

```clojure
(defn date-to-string-alternative-format [date]
  (f/unparse 
    (f/formatter "MM-dd-yyyy") 
    date))
    
(println (date-to-string-alternative-format date)) ; "01-01-2020"
```
