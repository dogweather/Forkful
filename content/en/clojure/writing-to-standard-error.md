## What & Why?
Writing to standard error (`stderr`) is a way to output error messages and diagnostics. Programmers do it to separate these from regular output (`stdout`), which makes debugging and logging easier.

## How to:
To write to standard error in Clojure, you'd use `binding` with `*err*`. Here's a quick example:

```Clojure
(binding [*err* *out*]
  (println "This will go to standard error"))
```

Sample output (in your shell):

```
$ clj your_script.clj 2> error.log
$ cat error.log
This will go to standard error
```

This snippet binds `*err*` to `*out*`, which is standard output, so you can see what would typically go to `stderr`.

## Deep Dive
Historically, Unix systems featured two separate output streams, `stdout` and `stderr`, for different data types. In Clojure, `*out*` refers to `stdout` and `*err*` to `stderr`. Alternatives to `binding` include using Java interop directly (e.g., `(.println System/err "message")`). Implementation-wise, `*err*` is a dynamic var, allowing for thread-local bindings â€” a nuance that can affect how errors are logged in concurrent applications.
