## What & Why?
Finding the length of a string in Clojure returns the number of characters in that string. Programmers often need this info to validate input, loop through characters, or for string manipulation tasks.

## How to:
To get a string's length in Clojure, use the `count` function:

```clojure
(count "Hello, World!") ;=> 13
```

This means "Hello, World!" has 13 characters.

## Deep Dive
The `count` function is the go-to in Clojure for finding the number of items in a collection, and strings are no exception since they can be treated as a sequence of characters. Historically, `count` has been part of Clojure since its early versions, reflecting its roots in Lisp where length operations are common on lists.

An alternative to `count` could be using Java interop because Clojure runs on the JVM:

```clojure
(.length "Hello, World!") ;=> 13
```

This calls the `.length` method from Java's String class. Though this alternative exists, using `count` is more idiomatic Clojure.

It's worth mentioning that `count` is O(1) operation for strings, which means it takes a constant amount of time regardless of string length since the string's length metadata is cached.
