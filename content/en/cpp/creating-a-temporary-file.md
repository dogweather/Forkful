## Why

Creating temporary files is a common practice in programming, especially in C++. These temporary files serve as a placeholder for data that is only needed for a short period of time and can be easily removed afterwards. It helps in efficient memory management and enhances the overall performance of a program.

## How To

Creating a temporary file in C++ is a simple process that requires the use of the standard library function `std::tmpfile()`. This function returns a file pointer to a temporary file that can be used to read and write data into.

```C++
#include <stdio.h> 
int main() 
{ 
    // Create a temporary file 
    FILE *fp = tmpfile(); 
    
    // Write data to the temporary file 
    fprintf(fp, "This is a temporary file!"); 
    
    // Read data from the temporary file 
    char buffer[100]; 
    rewind(fp); // Set the file pointer to the beginning 
    fgets(buffer, 100, fp); // Read data from file 
    printf("%s", buffer); // Output: This is a temporary file! 
    
    // Close and delete the temporary file 
    fclose(fp); 
    
    return 0; 
} 
```

The `tmpfile()` function automatically creates and opens a unique temporary file in binary mode, which will be deleted automatically when the file is closed or the program terminates.

## Deep Dive

In C++, the `std::tmpfile()` function is implemented using the `tmpfile()` function from the C standard library. It takes no arguments and returns a pointer to a temporary file. This pointer can be used to perform input/output operations on the file using standard C file functions like `fprintf()` and `fscanf()`.

One important thing to note about temporary files is that they are created in the default temporary directory of the system. This means that the file might not be created in the same directory as the program's executable file. To overcome this issue, the function `std::tmpnam()` can be used, which returns the name of a temporary file in the current directory.

Creating temporary files in C++ can be a useful technique for efficient memory management and temporary data storage. With the `std::tmpfile()` function, you can easily create and delete temporary files without worrying about the details of file management.
