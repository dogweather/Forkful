## What & Why?
Downloading a web page simply means fetching its content, usually in HTML format, to either view or process locally. Programmers download web pages to scrape data, monitor changes, or integrate with web services.

## How to:
In the current C++ version, you can use the `CURL` library to download web content. Here's a basic example:

```cpp
#include <curl/curl.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

static size_t writeCallback(void* contents, size_t size, size_t nmemb, void* userp){
    ((std::string*)userp)->append((char*)contents, size * nmemb);
    return size * nmemb;
}

int main() {
    CURL* curl;
    CURLcode res;
    std::string readBuffer;

    curl = curl_easy_init();
    if(curl) {
        curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "http://example.com");
        curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION, writeCallback);
        curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_WRITEDATA, &readBuffer);
        res = curl_easy_perform(curl);
        curl_easy_cleanup(curl);

        if(res == CURLE_OK) {
            std::cout << readBuffer << std::endl;
        }
        else {
            std::cerr << "CURL Error: " << curl_easy_strerror(res) << std::endl;
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Sample output:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Example Domain</title>
    ...
</head>
<body>
    <div>
        <h1>Example Domain</h1>
        <p>This domain is for use in illustrative examples in documents. You may use this domain ...</p>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

## Deep Dive
Originally, there was no standard way to download web pages with just C++. Programmers used platform-specific solutions or various third-party libraries. Now, `libcurl` is a widely supported and versatile library for transferring data with URLs. Compiled and linked with your C++ code, curl is a go-to tool.

Alternatives to libcurl include Poco's HTTPClientSession and C++ Rest SDK (aka Casablanca). While libcurl is C-based and about as low-level as you can comfortably go in terms of HTTP requests, Poco and Casablanca offer more idiomatic C++ interfaces which some may prefer.

Under the hood, when you download a web page, the HTTP protocol kicks into action. A GET request is sent to the server, and assuming all goes well, the server responds with the content wrapped in an HTTP response.
