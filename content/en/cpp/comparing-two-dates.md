## What & Why?
Comparing dates is about figuring out which of two dates is earlier, later, or if they're the same. Programmers do it for organizing events, expiring promotions, scheduling, reminders—basically, anything with a time component.

## How to:
C++ makes life easy with the `<chrono>` header.

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <chrono>
#include <ctime>

int main() {
    using namespace std::chrono;

    // Create system_clock time points
    system_clock::time_point today = system_clock::now();
    system_clock::time_point someDay = system_clock::now() - hours(24); // Yesterday

    // Convert to time_t for comparison
    time_t today_time_t = system_clock::to_time_t(today);
    time_t someDay_time_t = system_clock::to_time_t(someDay);

    if (today_time_t > someDay_time_t) {
        std::cout << "Today is after someDay.\n";
    } else if (today_time_t < someDay_time_t) {
        std::cout << "Today is before someDay.\n";
    } else {
        std::cout << "Dates are the same.\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Sample output:

```
Today is after someDay.
```

## Deep Dive:
Since C++11, `<chrono>` is where it's at for date and time. Before that, you were likely wrestling with `<ctime>` and structs like `tm`. Not pretty.

Alternatives? Sure, there's third-party libraries like Boost.DateTime. But why complicate when `<chrono>` is right there and evolving.

Implementation details to keep in your back pocket:
- `std::chrono` deals with time points and durations.
- `system_clock` measures real-world time.
- `time_point` is a specific point in time (e.g., a date).
- `time_t` is an arithmetic type, handy for comparisons.
