## How to:
C++ offers several ways to search and replace text. Below is an example using `std::string::find` and `std::string::replace`.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::string myText = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.";
    std::string wordToSearch = "lazy";
    std::string replacement = "energetic";

    size_t pos = myText.find(wordToSearch);
    
    if (pos != std::string::npos) {
        myText.replace(pos, wordToSearch.length(), replacement);
    }

    std::cout << myText << std::endl; // Output: The quick brown fox jumps over the energetic dog.
    return 0;
}
```

## Deep Dive
The `find` and `replace` functions have been part of C++'s `std::string` class for ages, making them a basic yet powerful means to manipulate text. Before `std::string`, C programmers used character arrays and functions like `strstr` and `strcpy` from the C Standard Library for similar tasks, which was more error-prone and required manual memory management.

As for alternatives, other standard library components like `std::regex` provide pattern-based text manipulation capabilities for complex searching and replacing scenarios. Third-party libraries like Boost offer even more sophisticated text processing options.

Under the hood, searching and replacing involves algorithms that iterate over a string to find matching sequences of characters and then modify the string's content accordingly. The efficiency of these operations may vary depending on the implementation and the complexity of the search pattern.
