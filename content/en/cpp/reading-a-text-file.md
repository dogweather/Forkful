## What & Why?

Reading a text file in C++ means interfacing with the file system to convert files to readable data. This is crucial for tasks like data processing, file management, and configuration.

## How to:

To read a text file, you interact with ifstream, a stream class to read data from files. Here's a simple illustration:

```C++
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::ifstream file("example.txt");
    std::string str;
    while (std::getline(file, str)) {
        std::cout << str << "\n";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This program reads data line-by-line from "example.txt", printing each line to the console.

## Deep Dive

Historically, file reading was more complicated but modern C++ abstracts these complexities. Earlier, coders had to deal with low-level system calls and handle anomalies themselves. 

An alternative to reading files is using the fstream library which allows read and write operations, but requires careful handling. 

Implementation-wise, ifstream accesses a buffer that interacts with the file system, abstracting the low-level details. It fetches data in chunks, reducing I/O frequency and improving performance.
