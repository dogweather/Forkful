## What & Why?

Sending an HTTP request is how your code asks another system for data or services over the web. Programmers do this to interact with web APIs, fetch web content, or communicate with other servers.

## How to:

Python's third-party `requests` library makes HTTP calls a breeze. Below is how to send a simple GET request:

```python
import requests

response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data')
print(response.status_code)  # Outputs the status code of the response
print(response.json())      # If response carries JSON, prints it as a Python dict
```

More detailed POST request with JSON payload and custom headers:

```python
import requests
import json

url = "https://api.example.com/submit"
data = {'key': 'value'}
headers = {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}

response = requests.post(url, data=json.dumps(data), headers=headers)

print(response.status_code)
print(response.json())
```

## Deep Dive

HTTP requests are how the web works â€” they've been around since the early 90s. Alternatives to Python's `requests` include the standard library's `urllib`, but it's a bit more cumbersome.

Understanding how to send HTTP requests involves knowing methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.), status codes (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found), headers, and body data. 

For streaming or asynchronous requests, you might explore `requests`' async counterpart or the `aiohttp` package. Underneath, these libraries use Python's `socket` for raw network communication.

Historically, `requests` is considered a go-to due to its simplicity and power, but `httpx`, a newer async-compatible library, is gaining traction.
