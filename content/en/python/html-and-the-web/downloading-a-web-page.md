## How to:
We'll use Python's `requests` library. If you don't have it, install it with `pip install requests`. Here's a quick example:

```python
import requests

url = 'https://www.example.com'
response = requests.get(url)

if response.ok:
    html_content = response.text
    print(html_content)
else:
    print("Failed to retrieve the webpage")

```

When this script runs, if successful, you'll see the HTML contents of "https://www.example.com" printed out in your console.

## Deep Dive
Before `requests`, Python had `urllib`. It's still around, but `requests` stole the show with its simpler, user-friendly interface. `requests` was released in 2011 by Kenneth Reitz and it has been the gold standard for HTTP in Python ever since. But it's not just about simplicity – `requests` is also robust, providing features such as session objects, cookie persistence, and automatic handling of SSL certificates.

There are alternatives like `http.client`, which is lower-level than `requests`, and external libraries like `aiohttp` for async operations. Deep under the hood, regardless of your choice, these libraries engage with web servers, send HTTP requests, and handle responses.

When downloading pages, it's important to consider the rules of the road: respect `robots.txt` files to know where you're allowed, and don't hammer servers – slow your requests down. Also, be mindful that web pages can pull in dynamic content with JavaScript which won't be captured with a simple HTTP request.
