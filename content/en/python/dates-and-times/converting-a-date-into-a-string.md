## What & Why?
Converting dates into strings changes a date object to a text format. Programmers do this to display dates in a user-friendly way or to prepare them for storage in text-based formats like CSV or JSON.

## How to:
Python makes it easy to convert dates to strings. Use the `strftime` method available on date objects. Here's how:

```Python
from datetime import datetime

# Get the current date and time
now = datetime.now()

# Convert it to a string in the format: Month day, Year
date_string = now.strftime("%B %d, %Y")
print(date_string)  # Output: March 29, 2023 (or current date)

# Format: YYYY-MM-DD
iso_date_string = now.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
print(iso_date_string)  # Output: 2023-03-29 (or current date)
```

## Deep Dive
Historically, date-string conversion has been a staple in programming due to the need to represent dates in a human-readable format. 

Alternatives to `strftime` include using the `isoformat` method for ISO 8601 format, or third-party libraries like `arrow` and `dateutil` that offer more flexible parsing and formatting options.

Implementation-wise, `strftime` stands for "string format time" and has roots in C programming. Python's `strftime` interprets format codes like `%Y` for the year and `%m` for the month, allowing for almost endless customizability.
