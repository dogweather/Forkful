## What & Why?
Standard error, often referenced as stderr, is a predefined file stream for logging error messages. Programmers use it to separate regular program output from error messages, which makes debugging easier.

## How to:
To write to stderr in Python:

```Python
import sys

print("This is a normal message.")
sys.stderr.write("This is an error message.\n")
```

Sample Output:
```
This is a normal message.
This is an error message.
```

Note that while `print()` adds a newline by default, `sys.stderr.write()` does notâ€”you need to include `\n` to start a new line.

## Deep Dive
Historically, standard streams were introduced in Unix. There are three: standard input (`stdin`), standard output (`stdout`), and standard error (`stderr`). In Python, the `sys` module provides access to these streams. While `stdout` is typically used for the main output of a program, `stderr` is reserved for error messages and diagnostics.

Alternatives to `sys.stderr.write()` include using `print()` with the `file` argument:

```Python
print("This is an error message.", file=sys.stderr)
```

This performs similarly but leverages `print()`'s user-friendly features. Regarding internal mechanics, both methods end up making system-level write calls to the respective stream.
