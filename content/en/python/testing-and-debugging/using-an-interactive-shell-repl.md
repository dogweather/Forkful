## What & Why?
A REPL, or Read-Eval-Print Loop, is a programming environment that takes single user inputs, executes them, and returns the result to the user. Programmers use it for quick tests, learning, debugging, or doing calculations on-the-fly. 

## How to:
Jump right into Python's REPL by typing `python` in your command line. Once there, test out simple operations or multi-line code:

```Python
>>> 1 + 1
2
>>> for i in range(3):
...     print(i)
... 
0
1
2
```

Experiment with functions and immediate feedback:

```Python
>>> def greet(name):
...     return "Hello, " + name + "!"
... 
>>> greet("Alice")
'Hello, Alice!'
```

Play with libraries and explore their features in real-time:

```Python
>>> import math
>>> math.sqrt(16)
4.0
```

Exit with a quick `exit()` or `Ctrl+D` (sometimes `Ctrl+Z` on Windows).

## Deep Dive
The concept of a REPL is not unique to Python; it's as old as Lisp. Many languages offer this immediate, interactive environment for a hands-on approach to code. Alternatives to the native Python shell include IPython and Jupyter Notebook, which provide enhanced interactivity, more features, and better integration with other tools. Python's standard REPL is simple, but it embeds the full power of Python, handling complex objects and multi-threaded programs, though it lacks features like auto-completion and syntax highlighting present in more advanced tools.
