## How to:
Python's `xml.etree.ElementTree` module offers tools to work with XML. 

Parse an XML document:
```python
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

xml_data = """<?xml version="1.0"?>
<library>
    <book>
        <title>Learning Python</title>
        <author>Mark Lutz</author>
    </book>
    <book>
        <title>Programming Python</title>
        <author>Mark Lutz</author>
    </book>
</library>
"""

root = ET.fromstring(xml_data)
for book in root.findall('book'):
    title = book.find('title').text
    author = book.find('author').text
    print(f'Title: {title}, Author: {author}')
```
Sample output:
```
Title: Learning Python, Author: Mark Lutz
Title: Programming Python, Author: Mark Lutz
```

Create an XML document:
```python
library = ET.Element('library')
book = ET.SubElement(library, 'book')
title = ET.SubElement(book, 'title')
title.text = 'Automate the Boring Stuff with Python'
author = ET.SubElement(book, 'author')
author.text = 'Al Sweigart'

tree = ET.ElementTree(library)
tree.write('library.xml')
```

## Deep Dive:
XML has been around since the late '90s, created as a simplified subset of SGML for easy online data sharing. Despite JSON's rising popularity for web data, XML remains vital in many enterprise, configuration, and web services (SOAP, RSS).

Alternatives to `xml.etree.ElementTree` include `lxml` and `minidom`. `lxml` is faster and more feature-rich, whereas `minidom` provides a more "DOM-like" XML interface. When choosing, consider ease of use, performance, and specific feature requirements.

Under the hood, `ElementTree` operates on an element tree model, where each component of the XML file is a node in a tree. This allows for straightforward path expressions and searches, making it easier to navigate and manipulate the structure of XML data.
