## What & Why?

Finding a string's length means counting its characters. Programmers do it to validate input, loop through strings, allocate resources, among other tasks.

## How to:

```python
# Simple usage of len() function
my_string = "Hello, World!"
length = len(my_string)
print(length)  # Output: 13

# Length in a loop
for i in range(len(my_string)):
    print(my_string[i], end='')  # Outputs: Hello, World!
print()  # For newline

# Combine string length with other operations
if len(my_string) > 10:
    print("It's a long string!")  # Output: It's a long string!
```

## Deep Dive

Historically, the `len()` function has been Python's go-to way to find a string's length. It's elegant and quick. Underneath, Python strings are arrays of bytes representing Unicode characters, and `len()` counts those. The function works not just with strings but with any iterable.

Alternatives? Well, not commonly used for strings, but you could loop through a string and count characters manually—unwieldy and inefficient. Before Unicode support, the length of a string was sometimes different from its memory size, but since Python 3's strings are Unicode-native, the `len()` accurately represents the number of characters.

Implementation-wise, Python strings are objects with metadata, including length, so `len()` is actually an O(1) operation—constant time, regardless of string size. That's like snapping your fingers and getting an answer.
