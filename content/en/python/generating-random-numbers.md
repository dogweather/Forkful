## What & Why?

Generating random numbers is making numbers appear "out of nowhere," without a discernible pattern. We use randomness in programs for tasks like anonymizing data, running statistical simulations, or adding gameplay variety.

## How To

Pythonâ€™s built-in `random` module makes this simple:

```Python
import random

# random float between 0 - 1
print(random.random())
```

Or get a random integer within a range:

```Python
import random

# random integer between 1 - 10
print(random.randint(1, 10))
```

## Deep Dive

Python's `random` module first appeared in version 1.1 (1994). It implements pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs), that generate seemingly random sequences from deterministic initial conditions, a "seed."

An alternative is Python's `secrets` module, which generates true random numbers, safe for cryptographic use.

We can even implement our own PRNG; Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) is the simplest:

```Python
def lcg(modulus, a, c, seed):
    """Linear congruential generator."""
    while True:
        seed = (a * seed + c) % modulus
        yield seed

gen = lcg(9, 2, 0, 1)
for _ in range(10):
    print(next(gen))
```
A bit complex, it's generally useful to stick with built-ins.
