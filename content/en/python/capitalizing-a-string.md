## What & Why?
Capitalizing a string means transforming the first character to uppercase and the rest to lowercase. Programmers often do this to standardize user input or to ensure proper nouns are formatted correctly.

## How to:
Use Python's built-in `capitalize()` method or `title()` method for this job.

```Python
# Capitalizing only the first letter
text = "hello, world!"
print(text.capitalize())  # Output: "Hello, world!"

# Capitalizing the first letter of each word
title_text = "hello, world!"
print(title_text.title())  # Output: "Hello, World!"
```

## Deep Dive
In times past, data consistency was a wild west. Inputs roamed free in varied forms. As databases grew, the need for standardized formats became apparent. Capitalizing strings for names, places, and titles became common practice.

Aside from `capitalize()` and `title()`, Python has other string methods, like `lower()` for all lowercase or `upper()` for all uppercase, offering flexibility for various use cases. `capitalize()` and `title()` come in handy when formatting is not just cosmetic but necessary for the meaning of the data â€“ like proper nouns or titles. 

Under the hood, methods like `capitalize()` work by iterating over each character in the string and applying Unicode rules to change their case. This involves some complexity with international characters, but Python's strong Unicode support handles this well.

Alternatives like string formatting with `str.format()` or f-strings don't offer case transformation directly, but can be combined with case methods for the desired effect:

```Python
name = "john doe"
formatted = f"{name.title()} is here."
print(formatted)  # Output: "John Doe is here."
```

Beware that `title()` method has its pitfalls, especially with words containing apostrophes or compound words, so always check your output or consider regex (regular expressions) for more complex scenarios.
