## What & Why?
Converting a string to lowercase means changing all uppercase characters in the text to their lowercase equivalents. Programmers often do this for consistency, comparison, or searching purposes since 'A' isnâ€™t the same as 'a' in the world of computers.

## How to:
Lowercasing a string in Python is simple with the `.lower()` method.
```Python
original_string = "Hello, World!"
lowercase_string = original_string.lower()
print(lowercase_string)  # Output: hello, world!
```
Or use a list comprehension for more control:
```Python
s = "HELLO, World!"
lower_list = [char.lower() for char in s]
print(''.join(lower_list))  # Output: hello, world!
```

## Deep Dive
The `.lower()` method has been a part of Python's string type since pretty early on. It's a straightforward way to ensure case-insensitive data processing, which is useful in situations like case-insensitive user inputs.

There are alternatives, such as using regular expressions:
```Python
import re

s = "HELLO, World!"
lower_s = re.sub(r'[A-Z]', lambda match: match.group(0).lower(), s)
print(lower_s)  # Output: hello, world!
```
But this is overkill for simply converting a string to lowercase.

Under the hood, Python's `.lower()` relies on Unicode character mapping. Unicode standard specifies the lowercase equivalent of almost all characters that have a case. This process is more complex than just subtracting a value to get from 'A' to 'a' because not all languages and scripts have such a simple and direct mapping.
