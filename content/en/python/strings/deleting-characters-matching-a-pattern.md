## What & Why?
In programming, deleting characters matching a pattern means finding sequences of characters that fit a specific rule—a pattern—and removing them from a string. Programmers do this for things like sanitizing inputs, processing text, or just cleaning up data before storing or displaying it.

## How to:
```Python
import re

# Example string
text = "Hello, World! 1234"

# Remove all digits
no_digits = re.sub(r'\d', '', text)
print(no_digits)  # Output: "Hello, World! "

# Remove punctuation
no_punctuation = re.sub(r'[^\w\s]', '', text)
print(no_punctuation)  # Output: "Hello World 1234"

# Remove vowels
no_vowels = re.sub(r'[aeiouAEIOU]', '', text)
print(no_vowels)  # Output: "Hll, Wrld! 1234"
```

## Deep Dive
The practice of deleting characters matching a pattern in text has deep roots in computer science, tracing back to early Unix tools like `sed` and `grep`. In Python, the `re` module provides this capability, leveraging regular expressions—a powerful and versatile tool for text processing.

Alternatives to the `re` module include:
- String methods like `replace()` for simple cases.
- Third-party libraries like `regex` for more complex patterns and better Unicode support.

Under the hood, when you use `re.sub()`, the Python interpreter compiles the pattern into a series of bytecodes, processed by a state machine that performs pattern-matching directly on the input text. This operation can be resource-intensive for large strings or complex patterns, so performance considerations are crucial for big data processing.
