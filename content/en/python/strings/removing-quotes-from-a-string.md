## What & Why?
Removing quotes from a string usually means stripping away extraneous double (") or single (') quotation marks. Programmers do this to sanitize input or when quotes are not needed for further processing—like when saving text to a database or preparing it for display.

## How to:
Python offers several ways to get rid of unwanted quotes from strings. Let's roll through some examples:

```Python
# Example 1: Using str.replace() to remove all instances of a quote
quote_str = '"Python is awesome!" - Some programmer'
no_quotes = quote_str.replace('"', '')
print(no_quotes)  # Output: Python is awesome! - Some programmer

# Example 2: Using str.strip() to remove quotes only from the ends
quote_str = "'Python is awesome!'"
no_end_quotes = quote_str.strip("'")
print(no_end_quotes)  # Output: Python is awesome!

# Example 3: Handling both single and double quotes
quote_str = '"Python is \'awesome\'!"'
no_quotes = quote_str.replace('"', '').replace("'", "")
print(no_quotes)  # Output: Python is awesome!
```

## Deep Dive:
The practice of removing quotes is as old as computer programming itself. Originally, it was simply about data cleanup. As systems evolved and started interacting through different layers—like UI, server, and database—cleaning strings became crucial to prevent errors or security issues. For example, SQL injections can be mitigated by removing or escaping quotes in user inputs before inserting the data into a database.

Some alternatives to the methods shown above include regular expressions, which can be overkill for simple quote removal but are powerful for sophisticated pattern matching. For instance, `re.sub(r"[\"']", "", quote_str)` would substitute all instances of single or double quotes with an empty string.

When implementing quote removal, remember that context matters. Sometimes you need to preserve quotes within a string but remove those at the ends, hence `strip()`, `rstrip()` or `lstrip()` are your friends. On the other hand, if you need to remove all quotes or handle encoded quotes like `&quot;`, you'll likely turn to `replace()`.
