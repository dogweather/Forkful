## How to:


### Using Python's Built-in Method:
Python has a built-in method `.capitalize()` for strings to accomplish this task easily. 

```python
my_string = "hello world"
capitalized_string = my_string.capitalize()
print(capitalized_string)
```
**Output:**
```
Hello world
```

### Handling Multiple Words:
For scenarios where you want each word in a string to start with a capital letter (such as titles), the `.title()` method can be applied.

```python
my_title = "python programming essentials"
title_case = my_title.title()
print(title_case)
```
**Output:**
```
Python Programming Essentials
```

### Using Third-Party Libraries:
While Pythonâ€™s standard library is equipped for basic string capitalization, libraries like `textblob` can offer more nuanced control, especially for natural language processing.

First, ensure you have `textblob` installed:
```bash
pip install textblob
```

Then, use it to capitalize strings, keeping in mind that `textblob`'s capitalize might work differently based on the context of use:

```python
from textblob import TextBlob

my_sentence = "this is a test sentence"
blob = TextBlob(my_sentence)
capitalized_blob = TextBlob(blob.string.capitalize())
print(capitalized_blob)
```
**Output:**
```
This is a test sentence
```

Remember, while the `capitalize()` and `title()` methods are universally useful, leveraging libraries like `textblob` can provide additional flexibility for specific applications.
