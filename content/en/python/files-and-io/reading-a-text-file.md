## What & Why?
Reading a text file in Python is grabbing data from a file that's accessible on your disk or over a network. Programmers read files to use the stored data (like configurations, user input, logs, etc.) within their applications.

## How to:
```python
# Reading the whole file at once
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)

# Reading line by line
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    for line in file:
        print(line.strip())
```

Sample output:
```
This is the first line of the file.
And this is the second line.
```

## Deep Dive
Reading text files is fundamental - and has been around since the early days of programming. Python's straightforward `open` function has roots in the C standard library function `fopen`. Some alternatives for reading text files include using libraries such as `pandas` for CSVs or `json` for JSON files. Internally, when you read a file, Python asks the operating system to open a file stream, which is like a conveyor belt delivering data from the file to your program.

For large files, instead of `read()` which loads everything into memory, use `readline()` or iterate over the file object with a `for` loop to handle one line at a time â€“ efficient and memory-friendly. While `with open` is the modern approach that automatically closes files, older scripts may use `file.close()` to do this manually, though it's error-prone if exceptions happen before the close call.
