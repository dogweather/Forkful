## What & Why?
Checking if a directory exists in Python is about verifying the presence of a folder in the filesystem before performing operations like reading or writing files. Programmers do this to avoid errors such as `FileNotFoundError`, ensuring the application behaves reliably and doesn't crash when attempting to interact with directories.

## How to:
Python provides native ways to check for a directory's existence using the `os` and `pathlib` modules. Here are examples for both:

### Using `os` module
```python
import os

# Specify the directory path
dir_path = "/path/to/directory"

# Check if the directory exists
if os.path.isdir(dir_path):
    print(f"The directory {dir_path} exists.")
else:
    print(f"The directory {dir_path} does not exist.")
```

### Using `pathlib` module
```python
from pathlib import Path

# Specify the directory path
dir_path = Path("/path/to/directory")

# Check if the directory exists
if dir_path.is_dir():
    print(f"The directory {dir_path} exists.")
else:
    print(f"The directory {dir_path} does not exist.")
```

### Third-party libraries
Although Python's standard library is sufficient for checking if a directory exists, libraries like `pathlib2` can be alternatives for consistency across Python versions or additional functionality.

***Note:*** As of the latest Python versions, `pathlib` is robust enough for most use cases, making third-party libraries less necessary for this specific task.
