## How to:
Python's `tempfile` module is built for this. Check out how it works:

```Python
import tempfile

# Create a temporary file and write something to it
with tempfile.TemporaryFile(mode='w+t') as tf:
    # Write a string to the temp file
    tf.write('Python is fun!')
    # Go back to the start of the file before reading
    tf.seek(0)
    # Read what we wrote
    print(tf.read())  # Outputs: Python is fun!

# And just like that, the file is gone when you're out of the block
```

This code uses a context manager to handle the file, which automatically cleans up after itself. No lingering files!

## Deep Dive:
Temp files aren't new. They've been used since the dawn of computing to hold ephemeral data. Python's `tempfile` module handles the dirty details like generating unique names and removing the files when done. If you want even more control, there's `NamedTemporaryFile`, which you can reference by a name during its short life. But remember, its purpose is to be temporary:

```Python
import tempfile

# Create a named temporary file
with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=True) as ntf:
    print(f'Temp file name is: {ntf.name}')  # It has an actual name!

# Still, it vanishes after use
```

And why not use regular files? Simple: Using `tempfile` saves you from clutter and potential conflicts â€” imagine your script rerunning and the same file name being reused. Messy, right?
