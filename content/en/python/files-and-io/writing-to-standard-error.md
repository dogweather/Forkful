## What & Why?
Writing to standard error in Python is about directing your program's error messages or diagnostics to the error stream (`stderr`), separate from the standard output (`stdout`). Programmers do this to differentiate normal program outputs from error messages, facilitating debugging and log analysis.

## How to:
### Using `sys.stderr`
Python's built-in `sys` module allows explicit writing to `stderr`. This approach is straightforward for simple error messages or diagnostics.

```python
import sys

sys.stderr.write('Error: Something went wrong.\n')
```
Sample output (to stderr):
```
Error: Something went wrong.
```

### Using the `print` function
Python's `print` function can redirect its output to `stderr` by specifying the `file` parameter. This method is useful for leveraging `print`'s user-friendliness while handling error messages.
```python
from sys import stderr

print('Error: Failure in module.', file=stderr)
```
Sample output (to stderr):
```
Error: Failure in module.
```

### Using the `logging` module
For a more comprehensive solution, Python's `logging` module can direct messages to `stderr` and much more, such as writing to a file or customizing message format. This method is best for applications requiring varying levels of logging, message formatting, or destinations.
```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.WARNING)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

logger.error('Error: Database connection failed.')
```
Sample output (to stderr):
```
ERROR:__main__:Error: Database connection failed.
```

### Third-party libraries: `loguru`
`loguru` is a popular third-party library that simplifies logging in Python applications. It automatically directs errors to `stderr`, among other features.

To use `loguru`, first install it via pip:
```shell
pip install loguru
```

Then, incorporate it into your Python script as follows:
```python
from loguru import logger

logger.error('Error: Failed to open file.')
```
Sample output (to stderr):
```
2023-04-05 12:00:00.000 | ERROR    | __main__:<module>:6 - Error: Failed to open file.
```
