## What & Why?

Converting a string to lower case in Python simply means transforming all the uppercase letters in a string to lowercase. Programmers do this to ensure uniform data, avoid duplication, and enable case-insensitive comparisons.

## How To:

Here's the Python code:

```Python
text = "Hello, World!"
lowercase_text = text.lower()
print(lowercase_text)
```

This will output:

```Python
'hello, world!'
```

## Deep Dive:

In Python, the `.lower()` method has been around since Python 1.5. It's a built-in method that directly works on string data types. 

-An alternative to using the `.lower()` method is using the Python's `str.casefold()` method, which is a more aggressive method than `str.lower()`. It's used for caseless matching, meaning it not only converts uppercase characters to lowercase, but even does a good job with non-ASCII characters.

-As for implementation, Python's `str.lower()` method follows Unicode Standard Annex #30 for Unicode character conversions. It makes sure to respect the cultural differences in lowercase character representations.
