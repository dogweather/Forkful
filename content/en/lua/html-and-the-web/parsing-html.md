## What & Why?
Parsing HTML involves extracting data and information from HTML documents, which is crucial for web scraping, data analysis, and automation tasks. Programmers perform this to gather, analyze, or manipulate web content programmatically, enabling the automation of what would otherwise be manual extraction of data from websites.

## How to:
Lua does not have a built-in library for parsing HTML, but you can utilize third-party libraries like `LuaHTML` or leverage bindings for `libxml2` through `LuaXML`. A popular approach is to use the `lua-gumbo` library for parsing HTML, which provides a straightforward, HTML5-compliant parsing capability.

### Installing lua-gumbo:
First, ensure `lua-gumbo` is installed. You can typically install it using luarocks:

```sh
luarocks install lua-gumbo
```

### Basic Parsing with lua-gumbo:
Here's how you can parse a simple HTML snippet and extract data from it using `lua-gumbo`:

```lua
local gumbo = require "gumbo"
local document = gumbo.parse[[<html><body><p>Hello, world!</p></body></html>]]

local p = document:getElementsByTagName("p")[1]
print(p.textContent)  -- Output: Hello, world!
```

### Advanced Example - Extracting Links:
To extract `href` attributes from all anchor tags (`<a>` elements) in an HTML document:

```lua
local gumbo = require "gumbo"
local document = gumbo.parse([[
<html>
<head><title>Sample Page</title></head>
<body>
  <a href="http://example.com/1">Link 1</a>
  <a href="http://example.com/2">Link 2</a>
  <a href="http://example.com/3">Link 3</a>
</body>
</html>
]])

for _, element in ipairs(document.links) do
    if element.getAttribute then  -- Ensure it's an Element and has attributes
        local href = element:getAttribute("href")
        if href then print(href) end
    end
end

-- Sample Output:
-- http://example.com/1
-- http://example.com/2
-- http://example.com/3
```

This code snippet iterates through all the links in the document and prints their `href` attributes. The `lua-gumbo` library's ability to parse and understand the structure of an HTML document simplifies the process of extracting specific elements based on their tags or attributes.
