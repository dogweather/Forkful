## How to:
Lua isn't equipped out of the box for web tasks, but with the `socket` library and `http` module, it's a cinch. Here's a quick example using LuaSocket:

```Lua
-- Don't forget to install LuaSocket: `luarocks install luasocket`
local http = require("socket.http")
local body, code = http.request("http://www.example.com")

if code == 200 then
    print(body)  -- Success! Prints the web page content.
else
    print("Something went wrong :(", code)
end
```

Sample Output:
```
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Example Domain</title>
...
```

## Deep Dive
Before LuaSocket, downloading web content in Lua was more cumbersome. Alternates like using `io.popen` to call `curl` or `wget` were common. 

LuaSocket has been around since 2004, making network interactions like HTTP requests straightforward in Lua. It works by wrapping TCP/IP socket API calls into easy-to-use Lua functions. For HTTPS, LuaSec can be layered on.

Lua's extensibility means you can also use other Lua-based frameworks or modules, like OpenResty for more complex web interactions within a high-performance web server environment.

Keep in mind, if you're doing hefty web scraping or complex processing, Lua may not be your go-to; Python with libraries like Requests and Beautiful Soup might serve you better.
