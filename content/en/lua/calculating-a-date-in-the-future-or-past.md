## What & Why?
Calculating future or past dates means figuring out what the date will be after or before a certain amount of time. Programmers do this for features like reminders, subscriptions, or to track past events.

## How to:

In Lua, you have the `os.date` and `os.time` functions at your disposal to help with date and time calculations.

```Lua
-- Add days to the current date
local daysToAdd = 10
local futureDate = os.time() + (daysToAdd * 24 * 60 * 60) -- days * hours * minutes * seconds
print("Future Date: " .. os.date("%Y-%m-%d", futureDate))

-- Subtract days from the current date
local daysToSubtract = 5
local pastDate = os.time() - (daysToSubtract * 24 * 60 * 60) -- same conversion as above
print("Past Date: " .. os.date("%Y-%m-%d", pastDate))
```

Sample output might be:
```
Future Date: 2023-05-03
Past Date: 2023-04-18
```

## Deep Dive

Lua's `os.date` and `os.time` functions have their roots in the standard C library. This means they're close to the metal â€” efficient and reliable. They don't fancy stuff like time zones or daylight savings time; they deal in UTC and seconds since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970).

Alternatives to `os.date` and `os.time` exist if you're looking for more. Libraries like `Luadate` offer more sophisticated operations, handling time zones and daylight savings with more finesse.

When it comes to implementation, keep an eye on leap seconds, and remember that adding a month isn't as simple as adding 30 days. Different months have different day counts, and February can either shortchange or surprise you with an extra day.
