## What & Why?

Reading a text file means loading its content into your program. We do it to process, analyze, or display stored data, like settings, logs, or user input.

## How to:

Let's check out how to read a text file line by line and then all at once.

```Lua
-- Read file line by line
local file = io.open("example.txt", "r") -- Open the file for reading
if file then
  for line in file:lines() do -- Iterating over each line in the file
    print(line)
  end
  file:close() -- Always close the file when you're done
else
  print("Cannot open file.")
end

-- Read the entire file at once
local file = io.open("example.txt", "r") -- Open the file for reading
if file then
  local content = file:read("*a") -- Read the entire content
  print(content)
  file:close() -- Close the file
else
  print("Cannot open file.")
end
```

Sample output for both snippets, if `example.txt` contains:
```
Hello, Lua!
```

The output will be:
```
Hello, Lua!
```

## Deep Dive

Historically, reading files is a fundamental operation, dating back to early computers. In Lua, this is handled via simple I/O model with the `io` library.

While `io.lines` and `io.read` are common ways to access a file's content, there are alternatives like `lfs` (LuaFileSystem) for advanced file operations.

When reading, Lua handles buffering behind the scenes, yet for large files, you should read in chunks to avoid high memory usage. 

Using the `io` library is straightforward, but always remember to close files to prevent resource leaks. On error, Lua file operations return `nil` and an error message, which you should handle for robustness.
