## What & Why?
Creating a temporary file is the process of making a short-lived file to store data that's only needed during the execution of a program. Programmers do it to avoid cluttering the file system with unnecessary data and to handle sensitive information that shouldn't stick around.

## How to:
Lua doesn't have built-in functionality for temporary files, but you can roll out your own solution using the `os` and `io` libraries.

```Lua
local os = require("os")
local io = require("io")

-- Generate a unique temporary filename
local function create_temp_filename()
    local temp_file_pattern = 'lua_tempfile_XXXXXX'
    local temp_filename = os.tmpname(temp_file_pattern)
    return temp_filename
end

-- Create a new temporary file
local temp_filename = create_temp_filename()
local temp_file = io.open(temp_filename, "w")

temp_file:write("This is a temporary file, it will be gone soon!")
temp_file:flush()  -- Ensure data is written
temp_file:close()

-- To confirm, let's check if the file exists and print its content
local file = io.open(temp_filename, "r")
print(file:read("*a"))  -- Output: This is a temporary file, it will be gone soon!
file:close()

-- Now delete the file when done
os.remove(temp_filename)
```

## Deep Dive:
Temporary files have been a staple in programming for temporary data manipulation since the dawn of modern computing. They’re essential for handling data that doesn’t need to be persistent or is sensitive enough to require immediate disposal after use.

In Lua, you'll have to manually manage temporary files because the language doesn’t provide a standard library specifically for this. The `os.tmpname` function generates a unique filename that can be used for a temporary file, but it doesn't create the file itself. It’s your job to create, manipulate, and remove it using the `io` library for file operations.

Under the hood, `os.tmpname` might behave differently depending on the underlying system's method for handling temporary files. For further safety, you could extend the `create_temp_filename` function to check for file existence to avoid collisions or use a more robust system-specific method.

As a side note, when working with temporary files, you need to be cognizant of potential security risks, like race conditions or vulnerabilities to symlink attacks on some systems. Always clean up after yourself by ensuring that these temporary files are deleted after their use.
