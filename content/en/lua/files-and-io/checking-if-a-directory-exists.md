## How to:
In Lua, you don't have a built-in function to directly check if a directory exists, so you often rely on the Lua File System (lfs) library, a popular third-party library for file operations.

First, ensure you have Lua File System installed. If not, you can generally install it using LuaRocks:

```sh
luarocks install luafilesystem
```

Then, you can use the following example to check for a directory's existence:

```lua
local lfs = require "lfs"

function directoryExists(directory)
    local attr = lfs.attributes(directory)
    return attr and attr.mode == "directory"
end

-- Check if a specific directory exists
if directoryExists("/path/to/your/directory") then
    print("Directory exists.")
else
    print("Directory does not exist.")
end
```

This will output:

```
Directory exists.
```

Or, if the directory doesn't exist:

```
Directory does not exist.
```

This approach uses the `lfs.attributes` function to get the attributes of the path. If the path exists and its `mode` attribute is `directory`, it confirms the directory's existence.
