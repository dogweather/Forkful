## What & Why?

Checking if a directory exists is a fundamental operation when writing scripts that interact with the filesystem, ensuring that your program operates on valid paths and prevents errors related to nonexistent directories. This task is crucial for creating new files in directories, reading from them, or performing directory-specific operations safely.

## How to:

In Lua, you don't have a built-in function to directly check if a directory exists, so you often rely on the Lua File System (lfs) library, a popular third-party library for file operations.

First, ensure you have Lua File System installed. If not, you can generally install it using LuaRocks:

```sh
luarocks install luafilesystem
```

Then, you can use the following example to check for a directory's existence:

```lua
local lfs = require "lfs"

function directoryExists(directory)
    local attr = lfs.attributes(directory)
    return attr and attr.mode == "directory"
end

-- Check if a specific directory exists
if directoryExists("/path/to/your/directory") then
    print("Directory exists.")
else
    print("Directory does not exist.")
end
```

This will output:

```
Directory exists.
```

Or, if the directory doesn't exist:

```
Directory does not exist.
```

This approach uses the `lfs.attributes` function to get the attributes of the path. If the path exists and its `mode` attribute is `directory`, it confirms the directory's existence.
