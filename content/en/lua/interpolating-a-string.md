## What & Why?
String interpolation lets you insert variables directly into strings. It's done to dynamically build strings and keep code clean.

## How to:
In Lua, use `..` for concatenation or `string.format` for interpolation. Example:
```Lua
local name = "Ada"
local greeting = "Hello, " .. name .. "!"
print(greeting) -- Output: Hello, Ada!

local age = 30
local bio = string.format("%s is %d years old.", name, age)
print(bio) -- Output: Ada is 30 years old.
```

## Deep Dive
Historically, Lua lacked built-in string interpolation, unlike some other languages (e.g., Ruby, Python). Concatenation with `..` was the go-to way. Lua 5.3 introduced `string.format` for a cleaner approach, similar to C's `printf`. **Alternatives:** Besides using the `..` operator or `string.format`, you can also write a custom interpolation function that uses gsub for pattern matching. But why complicate things? Use built-in tools for maintainability. **Implementation Details:** Be aware that frequent string concatenation can lead to performance issues. `string.format` is helpful when you need formatting control, like specifying number precision or padding.
