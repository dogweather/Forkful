## How to:
PowerShell is pretty handy with strings. Use the `.ToLower()` method, like this:

```PowerShell
$string = "HELLO, World!"
$lowerCaseString = $string.ToLower()
$lowerCaseString
```

Output:

```
hello, world!
```

Or try the `ToLowerInvariant()` method when cultural norms shouldnâ€™t affect the conversion:

```PowerShell
$string = "HELLO, World!"
$lowerCaseInvariant = $string.ToLowerInvariant()
$lowerCaseInvariant
```

Output:

```
hello, world!
```

## Deep Dive
Once upon a time, case insensitivity was pretty common in programming languages. In PowerShell, like its .NET ancestors, strings are objects with built-in methods for manipulation. When we use `.ToLower()`, we're invoking a method that handles the conversion process for us.

Alternative ways to get the job done? Sure. You could use:

- a `for` loop, visiting each character, and case switching manually
- Regular Expressions with the `-replace` operator
- Culture-specific conversions using overloads of `.ToLower()`
  
Why use the invariant culture with `ToLowerInvariant()`? It's essential for consistent results across different locales where the interpretation of what is a "lower" case could differ.
