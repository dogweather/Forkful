## What & Why?

Transforming dates into strings in PowerShell is the process of converting DateTime objects, which represent specific instances in time, to a readable text form. This simplifies data communication and visualization, enhancing clarity and precision when dealing with time-related data.

## How to:

In PowerShell, you can convert a date to a string using the `ToString()` method or the `Get-Date -Format` cmdlet. Check out these examples:

```PowerShell
# Using ToString()
$myDate = Get-Date
$stringDate = $myDate.ToString()
Write-Output $stringDate
```

```PowerShell
# Using Get-Date with Format parameter
$myDate = Get-Date -Format "yyyyMMdd"
Write-Output $myDate
```

In the first scenario, the output will be a string representation of the current date and time. The second example yields a date in the "yyyyMMdd" format.

## Deep Dive: 

Historically, `DateTime` objects evolved as a way of accurately storing and manipulating time within computer programming. However, being binary types, they are far from human-friendly. Hence came the need to convert them into a text form, which is more readily understood.

There are alternatives to the above methods like using cmdlets from the .NET Framework. You might use `DateTime.ParseExact`, `DateTime.TryParse`, or `DateTime.TryParseExact`. These provide more control over how the input string is interpreted but require complex syntax.

Implementation-wise, keep in mind that when converting a date to a string, the sequence of components (e.g., year, month, day) and their representation (numerical, textual) can vary, based on your needs. The conversion process is also affected by the active locale settings.
