# A Simple Guide to Reading Text Files in PowerShell

## What & Why?

Reading a text file in PowerShell essentially involves fetching and interpreting data from a .txt file. Programmers do it to extract, analyze, or transform information stored in these files efficiently.

## How to:

Two basic cmdlets in PowerShell to read text files are `Get-Content` and `StreamReader`. Let's use them in some examples.

```PowerShell
# Using "Get-Content"
Get-Content -Path 'C:\Path\to\yourFile.txt'
```

This code reads and displays the content of 'yourFile.txt'. Straightforward, isn't it?

Now, let's fetch specific lines:

```PowerShell
Get-Content -Path 'C:\Path\to\yourFile.txt' | Select-Object -First 5
```

Replace "5" to fetch the number of lines you want.

Now, let's use `StreamReader`:

```PowerShell
$streamReader = New-Object System.IO.StreamReader('C:\Path\to\yourFile.txt')
$line = $streamReader.ReadLine()
$streamReader.Close()
```

This code reads the first line of 'yourFile.txt'. Result? Itâ€™s more resource-friendly for large files.

## Deep Dive

Historically, PowerShell (since version 1.0) has provided an in-built way to interact with files. As PowerShell is built on .NET, it inherited the `StreamReader` class, however, `Get-Content` (alias `gc`, `type`, `cat`) is often the favored approach as it's more 'PowerShelly'. Remember, `StreamReader` needs extra steps (like explicit closing) but is lighter for big files.

There are also other alternatives like `Import-Csv` for CSV files, and `convertFrom-Json` when dealing with JSON.

Furthermore, `Get-Content` does have a `-ReadCount` parameter which can help when dealing with large files as it sends data down the pipeline in chunks rather than line by line.
