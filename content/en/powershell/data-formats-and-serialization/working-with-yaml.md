## How to:
PowerShell, by default, doesnâ€™t come with a built-in cmdlet for parsing YAML, but it works seamlessly with YAML when you leverage the `powershell-yaml` module or convert YAML into a PowerShell object using `ConvertFrom-Json` in combination with a tool like `yq`.

### Using `powershell-yaml` Module:
First, install the module:
```PowerShell
Install-Module -Name powershell-yaml
```

To read a YAML file:
```PowerShell
Import-Module powershell-yaml
$content = Get-Content -Path 'config.yml' -Raw
$yamlObject = ConvertFrom-Yaml -Yaml $content
Write-Output $yamlObject
```

To write a PowerShell object into a YAML file:
```PowerShell
$myObject = @{
    name = "John Doe"
    age = 30
    languages = @("PowerShell", "Python")
}
$yamlContent = ConvertTo-Yaml -Data $myObject
$yamlContent | Out-File -FilePath 'output.yml'
```

Sample `output.yml`:
```yaml
name: John Doe
age: 30
languages:
- PowerShell
- Python
```

### Parsing YAML with `yq` and `ConvertFrom-Json`:
Another approach involves using `yq`, a lightweight and portable command-line YAML processor. `yq` can convert YAML into JSON, which PowerShell can natively parse.

First, ensure `yq` is installed on your system.
Then run:
```PowerShell
$yamlToJson = yq e -o=json ./config.yml
$jsonObject = $yamlToJson | ConvertFrom-Json
Write-Output $jsonObject
```

This method is particularly useful for users who work in cross-platform environments or prefer using JSON within PowerShell.
