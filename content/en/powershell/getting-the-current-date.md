## What & Why?

Getting the current date in PowerShell is retrieving the present day, month, and year data. Programmers do it to log events, timestamp documents, or compare dates for various application needs.

## How to:

Get the current date using the `Get-Date` cmdlet as seen in the block below:

```PowerShell 
$currentDate = Get-date
$currentDate
```

It will display the present date including the time:

```PowerShell 
Thursday, March 10, 2022 11:05:25 PM
```

If you want just the date, format it this way:

```PowerShell 
$currentDate = (Get-Date).ToString('MM/dd/yyyy')
$currentDate
```

Your output will look like this, depending on the present day:

```PowerShell 
03/10/2022
```

## Deep Dive

Historically, PowerShell derived the `Get-Date` cmdlet from .NET's `DateTime` objects, hence the almost similar functionalities. Different methods of `DateTime` objects can be applied to it.

Alternatives to `Get-date` include `.NET classes` directly:

```PowerShell
[System.DateTime]::Now
```

A fun fact with PowerShell getting the current date is its ability to retrieve it in many ways. Not just 'now' but 'yesterday', 'last month', 'next week', etc. with `Get-Date`. It also easily formats dates, crucial for developers dealing with data presentation.
