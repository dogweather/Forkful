## How to:
PowerShell provides straightforward cmdlets for getting the date and time. The `Get-Date` cmdlet is the primary tool for this purpose. It can return the full date and time, which you can format or manipulate according to your needs.

```powershell
# Get the current date and time
Get-Date
```

**Sample output:**

```
Tuesday, September 5, 2023 9:46:02 AM
```

You can also format the output to display only the information you need, such as just the date or just the time.

```powershell
# Get only the current date in a specific format
Get-Date -Format "yyyy-MM-dd"
```

**Sample output:**

```
2023-09-05
```

```powershell
# Get only the current time
Get-Date -Format "HH:mm:ss"
```

**Sample output:**

```
09:46:02
```

### Using .NET Class
PowerShell allows direct access to .NET classes, offering an alternative way to work with dates and times.

```powershell
# Using .NET DateTime class to get the current date and time
[System.DateTime]::Now
```

**Sample output:**

```
Tuesday, September 5, 2023 9:46:02 AM
```

For UTC time:

```powershell
# Using .NET DateTime class to get the current UTC date and time
[System.DateTime]::UtcNow
```

**Sample output:**

```
Tuesday, September 5, 2023 1:46:02 PM
```

These commands and classes provide powerful and flexible options for working with dates and times in PowerShell, essential for many scripting and automation tasks.
