summary: Comparing two dates in PowerShell means figuring out if one is earlier, the
  same, or later than the other.
title: Comparing two dates
weight: 27
---

## How to:
```PowerShell
# Let's grab today's date
$today = Get-Date

# And here's an arbitrary date
$someOtherDate = Get-Date "2023-03-17"

# Are they equal?
$today -eq $someOtherDate

# Is today greater (later) than the other date?
$today -gt $someOtherDate

# How about checking if it's earlier?
$today -lt $someOtherDate

# Let's see the results, shall we?

False
True
False
```

## Deep Dive
Way back in the stone ages of computing—not really, but, you know, the early days—dates were messy. We've come a long way with standards and PowerShell simplifies it further.

Here are the bits worth chewing on:
1. **History**: Computers used to handle dates in various formats, leading to possible confusion and Y2K-style bugs. PowerShell relies on .NET's `DateTime` structure, avoiding such chaos.
   
2. **Alternatives**: You could also use `Compare-Object`, or leverage methods from `[datetime]` objects like `.AddDays()` to perform calculations before comparison. Remember `Measure-Command` to test performance impacts.
   
3. **Implementation Details**: PowerShell dates are objects with their own properties and methods. Comparing dates is done with operators (`-eq`, `-lt`, `-gt`), and, thanks to operator overloading, PowerShell knows you're dealing with dates, not just strings or numbers.

At the assembly level, date comparison translates to ticks (100-nanosecond intervals since 1/1/0001). So you’re essentially comparing large integers, which is efficient.
