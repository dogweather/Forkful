## What & Why?

Sending an HTTP request is how you ask for data or a response from a web service. Programmers do it to interact with APIs, fetch website content, or communicate with remote servers.

## How to:

Here's the straightforward deal for firing off a simple GET request:

```PowerShell
$response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri 'https://api.example.com/data' -Method Get
Write-Output $response
```

And, if you're looking to POST some info:

```PowerShell
$body = @{
    'name' = 'Jane Doe'
    'occupation' = 'Space Ranger'
}

$response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri 'https://api.example.com/users' -Method Post -Body ($body | ConvertTo-Json)
Write-Output $response
```

Sample output:

```
name         occupation
----         ----------
Jane Doe     Space Ranger
```

## Deep Dive:

Sending an HTTP request harks back to the dawn of web development. You're engaging in a dialog with the web in its native tongue, HTTP. PowerShell's `Invoke-RestMethod` cmdlet is the tool of choice here. Before `Invoke-RestMethod`, `Invoke-WebRequest` was the go-to, and it's still around for more detailed responses.

You've got alternatives like `curl` or .NET's `HttpClient` class if you're feeling adventurous. When using `Invoke-RestMethod`, remember it's a wrapper around .NET's `HttpClient` classes and methods, offering simplicity but trading off some lower-level control.

Implementation-wise, remember HTTP requests come with various methods like `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, etc. Customize headers with `-Headers`, and manage time-outs and authentication with extra params as needed. Always sanitize inputs if you're using user-generated content to avoid injection attacks.
