## How to:
To whip up a temporary file in PowerShell, you use `New-TemporaryFile`. This cmdlet creates a temporary file in your temp folder. Here's the magic spell:

```PowerShell
$tempFile = New-TemporaryFile
```

This line summons a brand new temporary file from the digital ether. Want to know where it lives? Just type:

```PowerShell
$tempFile.FullName
```

And bam! It'll tell you the file's path. When you're done and want to clear up, just remove it:

```PowerShell
Remove-Item $tempFile.FullName
```

The file vanishes, leaving no trace.

## Deep Dive
Now, let's get under the hood. Historically, temp files have been used since the dawn of computing, mainly because RAM was scarce and costly. These transitory files were a workaround for limited memory.

When it comes to alternatives, some devs handcraft their temporary file paths using `[System.IO.Path]::GetTempFileName()` which works across different .NET-supported languages and gives you more control. 

In PowerShell, `New-TemporaryFile` is actually a sleek wrapper around this .NET method. It creates a file at a path like `C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\Temp\tmpXXXX.tmp` (`XXXX` is a random number). The extension `.tmp` is a convention, signaling a temporary nature. 

Remember, temp files should be disposed of properly. If you're creating lots of them or handling sensitive data, you should scrub them securely to prevent data leakage.
