summary: Writing to standard error (stderr) in PowerShell involves sending error messages
  or diagnostics directly to the stderr stream, distinct from the standard output
  (stdout) stream.

## How to:
PowerShell simplifies the process of writing to stderr through the use of the `Write-Error` cmdlet or by directing output to the `$host.ui.WriteErrorLine()` method. However, for direct stderr redirection, you might prefer using .NET methods or the file descriptor redirection offered by PowerShell itself.

**Example 1:** Using `Write-Error` to write an error message to stderr.

```powershell
Write-Error "This is an error message."
```

Output to stderr:
```
Write-Error: This is an error message.
```

**Example 2:** Using `$host.ui.WriteErrorLine()` for direct stderr writing.

```powershell
$host.ui.WriteErrorLine("Direct stderr write.")
```

Output to stderr:
```
Direct stderr write.
```

**Example 3:** Using .NET methods for writing to stderr.

```powershell
[Console]::Error.WriteLine("Using .NET method for stderr")
```

This methodâ€™s output:
```
Using .NET method for stderr
```

**Example 4:** Redirecting error output using file descriptor `2>`.

File descriptors in PowerShell can redirect different streams. For stderr, the file descriptor is `2`. Here's an example of redirecting stderr to a file named `error.log` while executing a command that generates an error.

```powershell
Get-Item NonExistentFile.txt 2> error.log
```

This example does not produce console output, but generates a file `error.log` in the current directory containing the error message from attempting to access a file that does not exist.

In conclusion, PowerShell provides multiple methods for effectively writing and managing error output, allowing for sophisticated error handling and logging strategies in scripts and applications.
