## How to
PowerShell reads command line arguments using the `$args` array or parameters. `$args` is quick for one-off scripts; parameters are better for robust tools.

### Using `$args`
```PowerShell
# myscript.ps1
Write-Host "You entered the following arguments:"
$args
```
Run with `.\myscript.ps1 Hello PowerShell`, outputs:
```
You entered the following arguments:
Hello PowerShell
```

### Using Parameters
```PowerShell
# myscriptparam.ps1
param (
    [string]$Name,
    [int]$Age
)
Write-Host "Hello, $Name! You are $Age years old."
```
Run with `.\myscriptparam.ps1 -Name Sarah -Age 32`, outputs:
```
Hello, Sarah! You are 32 years old.
```

## Deep Dive
PowerShell's modern approach to command line arguments is akin to a legacy from its predecessors like cmd and Bash. However, it amplifies flexibility and precision.

### Historical Context
Years back, batch files and shell scripts accessed arguments with numbered variables (like `%1`, `%2`). PowerShell refined this with `$args` and named parameters for more clarity and control.

### Alternatives
There are alternatives, like parsing raw input with `Read-Host` or accepting piped input. However, `$args` and parameters are more seamless for automated tasks and scripts.

### Implementation Details
`$args` is a simple array, good for arbitrary input. Parameters, with their attributes and types, can validate input and even prompt the user, making scripts self-documenting and less prone to errors.
