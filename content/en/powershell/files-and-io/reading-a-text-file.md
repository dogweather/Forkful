## How to:
Let's roll with the basics! Here's how you read from a text file in PowerShell:

```PowerShell
# Get the content of a file
$content = Get-Content -Path "C:\path\to\your\file.txt"
# Display the content in the console
Write-Output $content
```

Sample output might look like this if your file contained a couple lines of text:
```
Hello, PowerShell!
End of file.
```

Now, want to read line by line?

```PowerShell
# Read the file line by line
$lines = Get-Content -Path "C:\path\to\your\file.txt" -ReadCount 0
foreach ($line in $lines) {
    Write-Output $line
}
```

Same sample output as above, but processed one line at a time.

## Deep Dive
Long before PowerShell, command-line tools like `cat` in UNIX-like systems or `type` in DOS were the go-to for reading files. PowerShell's Get-Content is the sharp tool for this today, with added perks like reading line by line, which helps in avoiding memory overload with huge files. 

Beyond `Get-Content`, we've got `.NET` classes up our sleeves for more control â€“ enter `System.IO.StreamReader`:

```PowerShell
$stream = [System.IO.StreamReader] "C:\path\to\your\file.txt"
try {
    while ($line = $stream.ReadLine()) {
        Write-Output $line
    }
}
finally {
    $stream.Close()
}
```

This is a more memory-efficient method, helpful for massive text mountains.

Alternatives? Well, you could use `Import-Csv` for CSV files or `ConvertFrom-Json` for JSON, if you want to scoop data into structured objects. But stick to `Get-Content` for the raw text stuff.
