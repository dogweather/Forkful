## How to:
Let's write a function to calculate the sum of two numbers. Simple, but it illustrates the point.

```PowerShell
function Add-Numbers {
    param (
        [int]$FirstNum,
        [int]$SecondNum
    )
    return $FirstNum + $SecondNum
}

# Call the function with 5 and 10
$sum = Add-Numbers -FirstNum 5 -SecondNum 10
Write-Output "The sum is $sum"
```

Sample output:

```
The sum is 15
```

## Deep Dive
Functions in PowerShell, like in most languages, are old news. Weâ€™ve been compartmentalizing code since the days of Fortran. It's about 'not reinventing the wheel'. Alternatives? Sure, scripts or cmdlets. But they lack the tidiness and context-sensitivity of functions within scripts.

Implementation? Functions can be basic like our example or complex with scopes, pipeline input, and more. Take `Advanced Functions`. They mimic cmdlets with parameters that have attributes, like `[Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]`. That's a taste of PowerShell's flexibility.
