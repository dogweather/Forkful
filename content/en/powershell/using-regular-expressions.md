## What & Why?
Regular expressions (regex) are powerful patterns for matching text strings. Programmers use regex to search, validate, or replace content efficiently.

## How to:
```PowerShell
# Match a pattern beginning with 'S' followed by any characters, ending in 'e'
$pattern = 'S.*e'
$text = 'Sample sentence in PowerShell.'
if ($text -match $pattern) {
    "Match found: $($matches[0])"
}

# Replace all occurrences of 'dog' with 'cat'
$petStory = 'The quick brown dog jumps over the lazy dog.'
$petStory -replace 'dog', 'cat'
```
Output:
```
Match found: Sample sentence in
The quick brown cat jumps over the lazy cat.
```

## Deep Dive
Regex has been integral to programming since the 1950s. While PowerShell has built-in cmdlets like `-match`, `-replace`, and `Select-String` for regex, alternatives for text manipulation exist â€“ think `string.Contains` or `string.Replace`. PowerShell's regex uses the .NET framework's implementation, hence it's robust and feature-rich.
