## What & Why?
Calculating a date in the future or past means figuring out what date it will be after or before a certain time period. Programmers do it to automate reminders, schedule tasks, or handle expiration dates.

## How to:

### Add days to the current date:
```PowerShell
# Add 10 days to today's date
$newDate = (Get-Date).AddDays(10)
Write-Output $newDate
```

Sample output:
```
Thursday, April 13, 2023
```

### Subtract days from the current date:
```PowerShell
# Subtract 15 days from today
$pastDate = (Get-Date).AddDays(-15)
Write-Output $pastDate
```

Sample output:
```
Wednesday, March 20, 2023
```

### Calculate the difference between two dates:
```PowerShell
# Difference between two dates
$date1 = Get-Date '2023-04-01'
$date2 = Get-Date '2023-04-15'
$diff = $date2 - $date1
Write-Output $diff.Days
```

Sample output:
```
14
```

## Deep Dive
Once upon a time, programmers had to manually calculate dates using complex algorithms. Now, languages like PowerShell provide built-in functions like `AddDays`, `AddMonths`, making it almost trivial.

### Alternatives:
While `AddDays` is handy, there are also functions like `AddHours`, `AddMinutes`, etc., for more granular control. Plus, you could use `[datetime]::Today.AddDays(10)` if you prefer a static approach.

### Implementation details:
PowerShell's `DateTime` object has these methods baked in, so you're not reinventing the wheel. Under the hood, it's handling all sorts of complexities like leap years and daylight saving adjustments for you.
