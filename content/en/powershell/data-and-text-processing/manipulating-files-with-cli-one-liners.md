## What & Why?

Manipulating files with CLI one-liners in PowerShell is about swiftly altering, moving, or obtaining file data directly from the command line. Programmers do it for efficiency; it's faster than navigating GUIs or writing lengthy scripts for simple tasks.

## How to:

### Reading a File
To quickly display the content of a file, use the `Get-Content` command:
```PowerShell
Get-Content .\example.txt
```

### Writing to a File
To write something new to a file, `Set-Content` can be used:
```PowerShell
Set-Content -Path .\example.txt -Value "Hello, PowerShell!"
```

### Appending to a File
Appending data to the end of a file without erasing its content can be done with `Add-Content`:
```PowerShell
Add-Content -Path .\example.txt -Value "Adding this line."
```

### Copying Files
Copying a file is straightforward with `Copy-Item`:
```PowerShell
Copy-Item -Path .\example.txt -Destination .\copy_of_example.txt
```

### Deleting Files
To remove a file, simply use `Remove-Item`:
```PowerShell
Remove-Item -Path .\unwanted_file.txt
```

### Searching Within Files
Use `Select-String` for searching text within files:
```PowerShell
Select-String -Path .\*.txt -Pattern "PowerShell"
```

### Combining Commands
PowerShell truly shines with its ability to chain commands using pipes. Here is how you can find files and copy them to a new directory:
```PowerShell
Get-ChildItem -Path .\*.log | Copy-Item -Destination C:\Logs
```

## Deep Dive

Historically, PowerShell was introduced as a more powerful alternative to the traditional command prompt in Windows, offering unprecedented access to system internals and data stores. It combines command-line speed with the flexibility of scripting, making it an invaluable tool for Windows-based system administrators and developers alike.

Alternatives to PowerShell for file manipulation include Unix-based tools like `sed`, `awk`, `grep`, and `bash` scripting for Linux and MacOS users. While these tools are extremely powerful and have their own merits, PowerShell offers deep integration with Windows environments.

A noteworthy aspect of PowerShell is its object-oriented nature. Unlike many scripting languages that treat everything as strings or streams of bytes, PowerShell works directly with .NET objects. This means when you manipulate files, you're working with rich objects that provide a plethora of properties and methods, making complex tasks more manageable.

One of the weaknesses of PowerShell, particularly for Linux and MacOS users, is its perceived verbosity compared to bash scripting or using Unix command-line tools. Additionally, PowerShell's deep integration with Windows can sometimes make cross-platform scripts a bit more challenging, though efforts with PowerShell Core aim to bridge that gap effectively.

Regardless of its weaknesses, PowerShell's strength lies in its powerful one-liner capabilities, integrated scripting environment, and the comprehensive access it provides to the Windows ecosystem, making it an essential tool for those looking to manipulate files and much more directly from the command line.
