## What & Why?

Modifying files using Command Line Interface (CLI) one-liners in PowerShell is about using succinct commands to edit, transform, or update files directly from the terminal. Programmers do it to quickly make changes to files without opening them in a graphical editor, speeding up workflow and enabling automation of repetitive tasks.

## How to:

To replace a specific string in a file, you can use the `Get-Content` and `Set-Content` cmdlets combined with the `ForEach-Object` cmdlet, like so:

```PowerShell
Get-Content ./example.txt | ForEach-Object { $_ -replace 'oldString', 'newString' } | Set-Content ./example.txt
```

To add a line to the end of a file, you can use the `Add-Content` cmdlet:

```PowerShell
Add-Content ./example.txt "This is the new line at the end of the file."
```

Suppose you want to remove blank lines from a file. In that case, PowerShell makes it straightforward:

```PowerShell
Get-Content ./example.txt | Where-Object { $_.Trim() -ne '' } | Set-Content ./cleaned_example.txt
```

And sample output for removing blank lines might simply be the content of `cleaned_example.txt` now excluding any of the empty or whitespace-only lines that were present in `example.txt`.

## Deep Dive

The power of modifying files with CLI one-liners in PowerShell is rooted in its comprehensive set of cmdlets, which are built upon the .NET framework, giving it a robust set of capabilities. This method harks back to the Unix philosophy of creating simple tools that do one job well, a principle that PowerShell expands upon by providing a versatile toolkit within a single shell.

Alternatives to PowerShell for this task include using Unix-based tools like `sed`, `awk`, or `grep` in environments like Bash. These tools are highly efficient and have been the go-to solution for file manipulation in Unix/Linux systems for decades. PowerShell's approach, however, integrates tightly with Windows' Object Model, providing a unique advantage in Windows environments.

A significant implementation detail to note is that PowerShell processes file content in memory, which makes it less efficient for very large files compared to some stream-oriented tools in Unix/Linux. Moreover, PowerShell's verbosity, while making scripts readable, can sometimes lead to longer one-liners compared to their Unix counterparts. However, for Windows-centric environments and tasks that benefit from the deep integration with the Windows ecosystem, PowerShell provides unmatched capabilities.
