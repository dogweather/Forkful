## What & Why?
Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code without changing its external behavior. Programmers do it to make code cleaner, more maintainable, and to reduce the complexity, which makes it easier to understand for someone diving in fresh.

## How to:
Consider a TypeScript function that's seen better days - it's a bit of a mess, and could use some tender love and care:

```typescript
function userInfo(data: any): string {
    return "User Info: " + data.name + ", " + data.age + ", " + data.email + ";" ;
}
```
Refactored, this might look like:

```typescript
interface User {
    name: string;
    age: number;
    email: string;
}

function formatUserInfo(user: User): string {
    return `User Info: ${user.name}, ${user.age}, ${user.email};`;
}
```

The second example is more robust, leveraging TypeScript's type system with an `interface` to avoid potential runtime errors and improve readability.

## Deep Dive
Refactoring isn't a modern concept; it evolved with programming, becoming more formalized with the release of Martin Fowler's book "Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code" in 1999. It's crucial in an Agile development environment, facilitating adaptive code changes. Some alternatives to manual refactoring include automated tools like TSLint or TypeScript's own language server that can suggest or even perform certain refactoring tasks for you. Implementation details usually involve recognizing "code smells," such as duplicate code, long methods, or large classes, and applying patterns to remedyâ€”like extracting methods, moving to more suitable classes, or using simpler constructs. These patterns are key to understanding the how and why of refactoring.
