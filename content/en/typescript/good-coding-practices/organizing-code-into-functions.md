## What & Why?
Organizing code into functions means chunking your code into reusable, modular blocks. We do this to keep things DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), making code cleaner, easier to read, and a breeze to debug.

## How to:
Imagine you're making a basic calculator. Instead of writing the addition logic everywhere you need it, create an `add` function:

```TypeScript
function add(x: number, y: number): number {
  return x + y;
}

console.log(add(5, 7)); // Sample output: 12
```

Now, let's say we need a function to multiply:

```TypeScript
function multiply(x: number, y: number): number {
  return x * y;
}

console.log(multiply(3, 4)); // Sample output: 12
```
Notice how we focus on one task per function? That's the heart of organizing code.

## Deep Dive
Historically, as programming languages evolved, functions became vital in structuring code, drawing from mathematical functions. They're a staple in procedural programming and live on in object-oriented and functional programming paradigms.

Alternatives? You could just not use functions, but that's a one-way ticket to Spaghetti Town. Or you could go OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) and pack functionality into methods—which are basically functions that belong to objects.

Implementation-wise, TypeScript insists on types. Defining input and output types for functions isn't just good manners; it's a must for clean TypeScript code. Plus, with TypeScript, you get nifty features like overloads, generics, and optional parameters to supercharge your functions.
