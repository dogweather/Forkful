## What & Why?

Comparing two dates involves figuring out their chronological relationshipâ€”are they the same, is one earlier, or maybe later? Programmers do this to schedule events, sort timelines, and check durations.

## How to:

Let's compare some dates:

```TypeScript
const date1 = new Date('2023-04-01T00:00:00Z');
const date2 = new Date('2023-04-02T00:00:00Z');

// Is date1 before date2?
console.log(date1 < date2); // true

// Is date1 the same as date2?
console.log(date1.getTime() === date2.getTime()); // false

// How many days apart?
const diffTime = Math.abs(date2.getTime() - date1.getTime());
const diffDays = Math.ceil(diffTime / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24)); 
console.log(diffDays); // 1
```

Sample output:

```
true
false
1
```

## Deep Dive

Back in the day, dates were a haystack of formats and mangled calculations. With JavaScript (and TypeScript by extension), the `Date` object simplified things, standardizing how we handle time.

Alternatives? Sure. Libraries like `moment.js` or `date-fns` augment date handling with extra functionality. But for basic comparisons? Native Date's simplicity often does the job.

Under the hood, `Date.getTime()` gets the milliseconds since epoch (Jan 1, 1970). Comparing these values clears out quirks of time zones and leap seconds, boiling it down to numbers.
