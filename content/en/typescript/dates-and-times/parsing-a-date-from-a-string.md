## How to:
TypeScript, being a superset of JavaScript, relies on the Date object for parsing dates from strings. However, working with dates in JS/TS can become verbose or imprecise due to the quirks of the Date object. Here's a basic example followed by an approach using a popular library, `date-fns`, for more robust solutions.

### Using JavaScript's Date Object
```typescript
// Basic parsing using the Date constructor
const dateFromString = new Date("2023-04-21T15:00:00Z");
console.log(dateFromString.toString()); 
// Output for GMT: "Fri Apr 21 2023 15:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)"
```

This method works for ISO format strings and some other date formats, but may yield inconsistent results for ambiguous formats across browsers and locales.

### Using date-fns
The `date-fns` library provides straightforward and consistent handling of dates. It's a modular library, allowing you to include only the parts you need, reducing bundle size.

First, install `date-fns`: 

```sh
npm install date-fns
```

Then, use it to parse a date string:

```typescript
import { parseISO, format } from 'date-fns';

// Parsing an ISO string
const dateString = "2023-04-21T15:00:00Z";
const parsedDate = parseISO(dateString);

// Formatting the date (e.g., into a human-readable form)
console.log(format(parsedDate, "PPPpp")); 
// Output: "Apr 21st, 2023 at 3:00 PM" (output may vary based on locale)
```

`date-fns` supports a wide variety of formats and locales, making it a robust choice for applications that necessitate precise date parsing and formatting across different user regions.
