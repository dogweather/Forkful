## Why 

We all know that programming with TypeScript can sometimes feel overwhelming, but it's also a powerful tool for creating robust and scalable applications. One common task in many projects is reading and processing text files. In this blog post, we'll dive into the process of reading a text file using TypeScript, and hopefully make it a little less intimidating for you.

## How To
Reading text files in TypeScript can be done using the built-in `fs` (filesystem) module. Let's take a look at an example code snippet below:

```TypeScript
import fs from 'fs';

//Reading a text file using fs module
fs.readFile('mytextfile.txt', (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
    return;
  }
  console.log(data.toString());
});
```

In the code above, we first import the `fs` module, followed by using its `readFile` method. This method takes in two parameters - the first being the path to the text file, and the second being a callback function that will be executed once the file is read. Within the callback function, we check for any errors and if there are none, we log the content of the file using `data.toString()`.

### Example Output
If we have a text file named `mytextfile.txt` with the following content:

```
Hello, World!
```

The code snippet above will output the following in the console:

```
Hello, World!
```

## Deep Dive
Now that we've seen a basic example of how to read a text file, let's dive deeper into the process. The `readFile` method is an asynchronous function, meaning that it won't block the execution of other code while it's reading the file. Instead, it will run in the background and once it's done, the callback function will be executed.

If we want to read a larger text file, we can use the `readFileSync` method instead, which is a synchronous function. This means that it will block the execution of other code until the file is read. However, it may be a better option for larger files as it can prevent any issues with concurrency.

We can also specify the encoding of the file as a second argument in both `readFile` and `readFileSync` methods. By default, it will return the raw file content, but we can specify `utf-8` as the encoding and use `data.toString()` to return a readable string.
