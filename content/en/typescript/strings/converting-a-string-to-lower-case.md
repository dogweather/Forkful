## What & Why?
Converting a string to lowercase means making every character in the string a small letter. Programmers do it for consistency, especially for case-insensitive comparisons, such as when checking user input against a list of commands or stored data.

## How to:
In TypeScript, making a string lowercase is a piece of cake. Just call `.toLowerCase()` on your string. Here's how:

```typescript
let myString: string = "HeLLo, WorLD!";
let lowerCaseString: string = myString.toLowerCase();
console.log(lowerCaseString); // Output: "hello, world!"
```

Easy, eh?

## Deep Dive
Back in the day, text processing wasn't always consistent, and character encoding could be a wild west. Now, with Unicode and standardized methods, cases are uniform across languages. Compared to `.toLowerCase()`, an old-school approach (like ASCII manipulation) is stone-age. Alternatives (like `.toLocaleLowerCase()`) consider locale-specific rules for proper casing, which can be handy. Under the hood, `.toLowerCase()` in JavaScript (and TypeScript by extension) goes through each character and, if it's an uppercase letter, transforms it to its lower-case equivalent based on Unicode mappings.
