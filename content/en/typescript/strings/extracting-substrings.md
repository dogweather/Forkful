## What & Why?
Extracting substrings means pulling out specific pieces of a string. It's handy for tasks like parsing data, validating input, or just breaking down text into more manageable chunks.

## How to:
In TypeScript, you slice and dice strings with methods like `substring()`, `slice()`, and the ES6 `includes()` for finding text within strings.

```TypeScript
let fullString: string = "Hello, TypeScript enthusiasts!";

// Grab from character 7 to 18
let substr: string = fullString.substring(7, 18);
console.log(substr); // Outputs: TypeScript

// Same deal but with slice()
let sliced: string = fullString.slice(7, 18);
console.log(sliced); // Outputs: TypeScript

// Check if a substring exists
let exists: boolean = fullString.includes("TypeScript");
console.log(exists); // Outputs: true
```

## Deep Dive
Once upon a time, string manipulation was more awkwardâ€”think C's string functions. Now, JavaScript and TypeScript offer methods that handle Unicode, respect character encoding, and work directly with string objects. `substring()` and `slice()` are similar but with a twist: `slice()` can take negative indices, retroactively counting from the end. `substring()` treats them as zeros. In performance-sensitive situations, picking one over the other can matter, but for day-to-day use, it's pretty much six of one, half a dozen of the other.

```TypeScript
// Using negative index with slice
let endSliced: string = fullString.slice(-25, -7);
console.log(endSliced); // Outputs: Hello, Type
```

As for `includes()`, it's a boon for readability over the classic `indexOf()`, making your intentions clear at a glance. No more `if (string.indexOf('some text') !== -1)`; just a straightforward `if (string.includes('some text'))`.
