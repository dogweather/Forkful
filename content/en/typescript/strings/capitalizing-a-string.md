## How to:
TypeScript, being a superset of JavaScript, allows for various methods to capitalize strings, ranging from pure JavaScript approaches to utilizing third-party libraries for more complex or specific use cases.

**Pure JavaScript Approach:**

```typescript
function capitalize(str: string): string {
  return str.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + str.slice(1);
}

// Sample Output:
console.log(capitalize('hello TypeScript!')); // 'Hello TypeScript!'
```

This method is straightforward and relies on the `charAt()` method to access the first character of the string and `toUpperCase()` to convert it to uppercase. The `slice(1)` method then retrieves the rest of the string, leaving it unchanged.

**Using Lodash Library:**

For projects already using the [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) library, you can utilize its `_.capitalize` function to achieve the same result with less boilerplate code.

First, install Lodash:

```bash
npm install lodash
```

Then, use it in your TypeScript file:

```typescript
import * as _ from 'lodash';

// Sample Output:
console.log(_.capitalize('hello TypeScript!')); // 'Hello typescript!'
```

Note: Lodash's `_.capitalize` method converts the rest of the string to lowercase which might not always be what you want.

**Using a Regular Expression:**

A regular expression can provide a concise way to capitalize the first letter of a string, especially if you need to capitalize the first letter of each word in a string.

```typescript
function capitalizeWords(str: string): string {
  return str.replace(/\b\w/g, char => char.toUpperCase());
}

// Sample Output:
console.log(capitalizeWords('hello typescript world!')); // 'Hello Typescript World!'
```

This method uses the `replace()` function to search for any word boundary followed by an alphanumeric character (`\b\w`), capitalizing each match. It's particularly handy for titles or headings.
