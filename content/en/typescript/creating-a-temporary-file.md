## What & Why?

Creating a temporary file is an integral part of programming that involves producing an impermanent file for short-term storage and data manipulation. Programmers do this to flexibly handle large data streams, stage changes, and perform testing without modifying the application's actual data.

## How to:

To create a temporary file in TypeScript, we'll use the `tmp-promise` library. Here's an example of how to do this:

```TypeScript
import { file } from "tmp-promise";

async function main() {
    const { path, fd, cleanup } = await file({ prefix: 'myTmpFile-', postfix: '.txt' });

    console.log(path); // prints the file path
    
    // Remember to clean up
    await cleanup();
}
main();
```

To run the code, install the required library with `npm install tmp-promise`. The `path` output is the unique temporary file created with a prefix of 'myTmpFile-' and a postfix of '.txt'. Remember to call `cleanup()` method when you're done with the temp file to prevent accumulation and waste of system resources.

## Deep Dive

The concept of temporary files has been with us since the early days of programming, where system memory was highly constrained. Temporary files are essentially a form of data swapping onto disk space, providing an efficient mechanism for manipulations that can't be performed in-memory.

In TypeScript, you could alternatively manipulate data in arrays or objects, but these methods can become increasingly resource-intensive for larger datasets. So, temporary files remain a good option for managing such oversized data while not clogging your app's memory.

While creating a temporary file using the `tmp-promise` library is pretty straightforward, it's important to note that the `cleanup` function deletes the created file and should be used judiciously. The removal of these temporary files helps maintain the system's optimal performance and prevents the disk space from being inundated with unnecessary data.

If you find that temporary files perfectly address a specific use case for you, then by all means, use them. The right tool for the right job always speeds things up!
