## What & Why?
Parsing a date from a string means converting text into a Date object. Programmers do it to manipulate and use dates in a format computers understand.

## How to:

```TypeScript
// Basic parsing using the Date constructor
const myDate = new Date('2020-01-01');
console.log(myDate.toString()); // Outputs: Wed Jan 01 2020 ...

// Parsing with a library like date-fns
import { parseISO } from 'date-fns';

const myParsedDate = parseISO('2020-01-01');
console.log(myParsedDate.toString()); // Outputs: Wed Jan 01 2020 ...
```

Sample output for both:
```
Wed Jan 01 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)
```

## Deep Dive

Parsing dates from strings has always been a bit of a pain point in JavaScript, the root language of TypeScript. Inaccurate or inconsistent parsing across different browsers led programmers to seek more reliable solutions.

Historically, Moment.js was the go-to library for date parsing and manipulation, but it's now considered a legacy project. Alternatives like date-fns and Day.js offer similar functionality with smaller footprints.

Parsing involves taking care of formats, timezones, and locales. Different countries can have different date formats, e.g., `MM/DD/YYYY` vs. `DD/MM/YYYY`. Timezones can distort the actual point in time represented if not handled properly.

Special care must be taken when implementing a parser:

1. **Consistency**: Make sure the date is parsed the same way across all environments your application runs in.
2. **Validation**: Check that the string is actually a valid date.
3. **Locale & Timezone Handling**: Use libraries or built-in APIs like `Intl.DateTimeFormat` to handle this.

Libraries abstract these complexities, allowing you to parse strings into date objects through simple function calls.
