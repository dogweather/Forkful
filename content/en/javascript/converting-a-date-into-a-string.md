## What & Why?
Converting a date into a string in JavaScript means transforming a `Date` object into a read-friendly text format. We do it to make timestamps more human-readable, store dates easily, or exchange data in JSON.

## How to:
Converting a date into a string in JavaScript is simple. One of the most straightforward ways involves using the `toString()` method. 
Here's an example:
```JavaScript
let currentDate = new Date();
console.log(currentDate.toString());
```
You're likely to get an output similar to: 
`Mon Apr 26 2021 16:43:32 GMT+0300 (Eastern European Summer Time)`. 

JavaScript's `Date` object also supports several other methods like `toDateString()`, `toTimeString()`, `toISOString()`, and `toLocaleString()`. Each returns the date string in a different format.

```JavaScript
let currentDate = new Date();

console.log(currentDate.toDateString());
// Mon Apr 26 2021

console.log(currentDate.toTimeString());
// 16:43:32 GMT+0300 (Eastern European Summer Time)

console.log(currentDate.toISOString());
// 2021-04-26T13:43:32.160Z

console.log(currentDate.toLocaleString());
// 4/26/2021, 4:43:32 PM
```
## Deep Dive
The concept of transforming data from one type to another, like from a `Date` object to a `String`, is no modern invention. It's a widespread practice in almost all languages, going back decades.

JavaScript's built-in `Date` object provides different methods for formatting dates to suit various purposes. However, they don't always offer enough customizability. In such times, programmers often resort to libraries like `moment.js` or `date-fns` which provide more formatting options.

When implementing date-to-string conversion in JavaScript, note that the output can be influenced by the user's locale settings (e.g., `toLocaleString()`). Although universal standards exist (like ISO 8601, returned by `toISOString()`), real-world application can vary and often requires more nuanced formatting.
