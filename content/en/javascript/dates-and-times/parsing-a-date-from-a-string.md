## How to:
JavaScript natively offers the `Date.parse()` method and the `Date` constructor to parse date strings. However, these approaches have limitations and inconsistencies across different browsers, especially with non-standard date formats. To address these issues, third-party libraries like `Moment.js` and `date-fns` are popular for their robustness and ease of use.

### Using native JavaScript:
```javascript
const dateString = "2023-04-30T14:55:00";
const dateObj = new Date(dateString);

console.log(dateObj);  // Output: Sun Apr 30 2023 14:55:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)
```

### Using Moment.js:
First, install Moment.js via npm or include it in your project. Then:
```javascript
const moment = require('moment');

const dateString = "2023-04-30T14:55:00";
const dateObj = moment(dateString);

console.log(dateObj.toString());  // Output: Sun Apr 30 2023 14:55:00 GMT+0000
```

### Using date-fns:
After adding `date-fns` to your project, parse a date string like so:
```javascript
const { parseISO } = require('date-fns');

const dateString = "2023-04-30T14:55:00";
const dateObj = parseISO(dateString);

console.log(dateObj);  // Output: 2023-04-30T14:55:00.000Z
```

Both `Moment.js` and `date-fns` provide more comprehensive parsing capabilities, including handling a variety of formats and locales, which makes them preferable for complex applications.
