## How to:
Here's the classic `try-catch` block:

```javascript
try {
  // Code that might throw an error
  let result = potentiallyRiskyOperation();
  console.log('Success:', result);
} catch (error) {
  // What to do if an error is thrown
  console.error('Oops:', error.message);
}
```

Sample output when no error occurs:
```
Success: 42
```

And when there's an error:
```
Oops: Something went wrong
```

For asynchronous code, where promises are involved, use `try-catch` in an `async` function:

```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    let data = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
    console.log('Data fetched:', data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching data:', error.message);
  }
}

fetchData();
```

## Deep Dive
Error handling in JavaScript has evolved. Back in the day (ES3, circa 1999), we just had the `try-catch` block. Not super flexible, but it did the job.

ES6 (2015) introduced Promises and gave us `.then()` and `.catch()`, allowing us to handle asynchronous errors more gracefully.

```javascript
fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then(data => console.log('Data fetched:', data))
  .catch(error => console.error('Error fetching data:', error.message));
```

As for implementation details, when an error is thrown, JavaScript engines create an `Error` object with useful properties like `message` and `stack`. You can also make custom error types by extending the `Error` class â€“ handy for more complex apps.

Alternatives? You could ignore error handling (bad idea), use callbacks with error-first parameters (hello, Node.js style), or get fancier with libraries and frameworks that offer their takes.
