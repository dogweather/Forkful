## How to:
Let's parse HTML using the `DOMParser` API in JavaScript. 

```Javascript
const parser = new DOMParser();
const htmlString = `<p>Hello, world!</p>`;
const doc = parser.parseFromString(htmlString, 'text/html');
console.log(doc.body.textContent); // Output: Hello, world!
```

Now, let’s grab something more specific, like an element with a class:

```Javascript
const htmlString = `<div><p class="greeting">Hello, again!</p></div>`;
const doc = parser.parseFromString(htmlString, 'text/html');
const greeting = doc.querySelector('.greeting').textContent;
console.log(greeting); // Output: Hello, again!
```

## Deep Dive
Parsing HTML is old as the web. Initially, it was a browser thing—browsers parsed HTML to display web pages. Over time, programmers wanted to tap into this process, leading to APIs like `DOMParser`.

Alternatives? Sure. We've got libraries like `jQuery` and tools like `BeautifulSoup` for Python. But JavaScript’s native `DOMParser` is fast and built-in, no need for extra libraries.

Implementation-wise, when you parse HTML with `DOMParser`, it creates a `Document` object. Think of it as a hierarchical model of your HTML. Once you have it, you can navigate and manipulate it just like you would with a normal web page’s DOM.

Here's the thing—parsing can trip on malformed HTML. Browsers are forgiving, but `DOMParser` might not be. Hence, for complex tasks or messy HTML, third-party libraries might do a better cleanup job.
