## Why

Starting a new project in Javascript may seem daunting, but it can be a great way to challenge yourself and improve your skills. Plus, with the demand for Javascript developers on the rise, it's a valuable addition to your programming portfolio.

## How To

To start a new Javascript project, follow these steps:

```Javascript
// Initialize a new npm project
npm init 
// Install any necessary packages or dependencies
npm install package-name
// Create a new file and add your code
let greeting = "Hello World!";
console.log(greeting);
// Compile and run your code
node index.js
// You should see the output "Hello World!" in your terminal
```

Creating a package.json file with `npm init` allows you to easily manage your project dependencies. You can install any necessary packages with `npm install` and use them in your code. Make sure to create a separate file for your code and run it with `node filename.js` in your terminal.

## Deep Dive

When starting a new project in Javascript, it's important to have a clear understanding of your goals and project requirements. This will help guide your code structure and prevent any unnecessary complications down the line. It's also helpful to plan out and break down your project into smaller, manageable tasks.

Additionally, it's important to consider the scalability and readability of your code. Using proper coding conventions and commenting your code can make it easier for others to understand and contribute to your project in the future. And don't be afraid to experiment with different techniques and libraries to improve your skills and make your project stand out.
