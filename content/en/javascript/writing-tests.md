## Why
As developers, we often focus on writing code to make sure our applications run smoothly and efficiently. But have you ever thought about the importance of writing tests? Writing tests might seem like an extra step, but in fact, they play a crucial role in ensuring the quality of our code and preventing potential bugs.

## How To
Writing tests using Javascript might seem daunting at first, but it's actually fairly straightforward. Let's take a look at an example of a simple function and how we can write a test for it.

```Javascript
//Function to check if a number is even
const isEven = (num) => {
  return num % 2 === 0;
}
```

To write a test for this function, we can use a testing framework like Jest. First, we need to install Jest in our project using `npm install --save-dev jest`. Then, we can create a separate test file for our function.

```Javascript
//Test for isEven function
const isEven = require('./isEven');

test('should return true if number is even', () => {
  expect(isEven(4)).toBe(true);
});

test('should return false if number is odd', () => {
  expect(isEven(5)).toBe(false);
});
```

In the first test, we check if the function returns true for an even number, and in the second test, we check if it returns false for an odd number. Running the test using `jest` in the terminal will show us the output of the tests, which should all pass.

```
PASS ./isEven.test.js
✓ should return true if number is even (5ms)
✓ should return false if number is odd (1ms)
PASS src/isEven.js
✓ should return true if number is even
✓ should return false if number is odd
```

## Deep Dive
Now that we have a basic understanding of how to write tests, let's take a deeper look at why they are important. Writing tests helps us catch bugs early on in the development process, saving us time and effort in the long run. It also allows us to make changes to our code with confidence, knowing that we have tests in place to ensure that our changes don't break anything.

In addition, tests serve as a form of documentation for our code. They show us how our code should be used and what kind of output we can expect. This can be especially helpful when working on a team or revisiting old code.

Furthermore, writing tests can also lead to better code. When we write tests, we are forced to think about different scenarios and edge cases, which can help us write more robust and error-free code.
