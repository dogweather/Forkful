## What & Why?
Interactive shells, or REPLs (Read-Eval-Print Loops), let you run code on the fly, testing functions, algorithms, or fiddling with ideas. They're the scratch pads of coding, quick and dirty, without setting up a full dev environment.

## How to:
Node.js ships with a REPL accessible via the terminal. Pop it open, and you're ready to roll. Here's a taste:

```javascript
$ node
> let sum = (a, b) => a + b;
undefined
> sum(5, 10);
15
> .exit
```

Straightforward, right? Define variables, functions, or run loops. When done, `.exit` takes you back to the real world.

## Deep Dive
REPLs have been around since the 1960s â€“ LISP pioneered the concept. The idea: give immediate feedback to the programmer. Alternatives? Besides Node.js REPL, there's browser-based consoles like Chrome DevTools, online sandboxes like JSFiddle, or full IDEs like VSCode with interactive playgrounds.

Under the hood, REPL workflows typically: 
1. Read input
2. Compile and execute code
3. Print output
4. Loop back

It's a simple yet effective cycle that has massively influenced interactive coding.
