## How to:
Before you write code, decide on tools and structure. Let's use Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) for this example.

1. Install Node.js from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Open a terminal and run:

```javascript
npm init
```

Answer the setup questions. Boomâ€”`package.json` is created, describing your project. Next, let's add Express, a popular web framework:

```javascript
npm install express --save
```

Now, write a simple web server in `index.js`:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is up on port 3000');
});
```

Run your server:

```javascript
node index.js
```

Sample output:

```
Server is up on port 3000
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser. You should see "Hello World!".

## Deep Dive
Historically, project setup was a pain, with lots of manual configuration. Nowadays, tools like npm do the heavy lifting. For front-end projects, consider `create-react-app` or `vue-cli`. For Node.js, Express is a solid choice, balancing power with simplicity. It's lightweight but has robust features for most web server needs.

Remember, how you organize your project is critical. Traditional Node.js apps have an entry point (like `index.js`), a `package.json` file to manage dependencies, and a folder structure that separates concerns (modules, utilities, routes, etc.).

Alternatives to npm for package management include Yarn, which offers speed and consistency improvements. For project scaffolding, Yeoman helps by providing generators for many types of projects and technologies.
