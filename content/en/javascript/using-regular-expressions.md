## Why
Regular expressions, or regex for short, are a powerful tool for text manipulation and pattern matching in programming. They allow us to search, replace, and extract specific pieces of text from large amounts of data. Whether you're parsing through user input, validating data, or cleaning up text, regular expressions can make your code more efficient and robust.

## How To
To use regular expressions in Javascript, we first need to create a regular expression object using the `RegExp` constructor. We can pass in a string containing the pattern we want to match, along with optional flags to modify the search behavior. For example:

```Javascript
let regex = new RegExp("hello", "i");
```

In this case, our regular expression will match the word "hello" in a case-insensitive manner. We can then use this regex object with methods like `test()` and `exec()` to search for patterns in strings.

```Javascript
let str = "Hello world!";
regex.test(str); // returns true
regex.exec(str); // returns ["Hello"]
```

We can also use regex with methods like `replace()` and `split()` to manipulate strings based on patterns. For example, let's say we want to replace all instances of "cat" or "dog" with "pet" in a string:

```Javascript
let str = "I have a cat and a dog. They are the best pets!";
let regex = new RegExp("cat|dog", "gi");
let newStr = str.replace(regex, "pet");
// newStr is now "I have a pet and a pet. They are the best pets!"
```
Regular expressions also have a shorthand syntax in Javascript using forward slashes `/`, which is often preferred for its concise and readable format. The above example can be rewritten as:

```Javascript
let newStr = str.replace(/cat|dog/gi, "pet");
```

There are many other useful features and techniques for using regular expressions in Javascript, such as grouping, quantifiers, and capturing groups. For a more in-depth look, check out the resources listed in the "See Also" section below.

## Deep Dive
Regular expressions may seem daunting at first, with their cryptic symbols and patterns, but they can greatly improve the efficiency and readability of our code once we understand how to use them. They are supported in most programming languages and text editors, making them a valuable skill to have in your toolbox.

One thing to keep in mind when using regular expressions is that they are powerful, but they can also be complex and prone to errors. It's important to thoroughly test and debug your regex patterns to ensure they give the desired results. Online tools like [Regex101](https://regex101.com/) and [Regexr](https://regexr.com/) can be helpful for experimentation and testing.

Another thing to note is that while regular expressions are useful for many simple cases, they may not be the best solution for more complex tasks like parsing HTML or processing large datasets. In those situations, a combination of regex and other methods may be necessary.
