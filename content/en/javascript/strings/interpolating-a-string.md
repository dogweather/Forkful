## What & Why?

String interpolation is a way to embed variables directly within a string. Programmers use it to concatenate variables and strings efficiently, making code easier to read and maintain.

## How to:

In JavaScript, string interpolation is often done using template literals. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

```javascript
const name = 'Alice';
const message = `Hello, ${name}! How are you today?`;
console.log(message); // Outputs: Hello, Alice! How are you today?
```

You can also perform operations within placeholders:

```javascript
const a = 10;
const b = 5;
console.log(`Ten times five is ${a * b}.`); // Outputs: Ten times five is 50.
```

## Deep Dive

Historically, string interpolation wasn't as straightforward in JavaScript. Before ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), concatenation was commonly done using the `+` operator:

```javascript
var name = 'Bob';
var message = 'Hello, ' + name + '! How are you today?';
```

With the introduction of ES6, template literals (between backticks \` \`) came along, bringing an easier syntax with the `${}` placeholders.

Alternatives to string interpolation include string concatenation with the `+` operator and `concat()` method, or using `sprintf`-like functions from third-party libraries.

The performance of template literals is generally on par with these older methods. However, readability and the ability to include expressions (like `${a * b}`) within strings make template literals a strong choice for developers.
