## What & Why?
Capitalizing a string means converting the first character of the string to uppercase while keeping the remaining characters as is. This operation is commonly performed in JavaScript for formatting user inputs, displaying names or titles, and ensuring consistency in user interface texts.

## How to:
In JavaScript, there isn’t a built-in method to directly capitalize strings, but it's straightforward to implement using basic string manipulation methods.

### Using Standard JavaScript
```javascript
function capitalize(str) {
  if (!str) return '';
  return str.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + str.slice(1);
}

console.log(capitalize('hello world')); // Output: "Hello world"
```

### ES6 Version
With ES6 template literals, the function can be written in a more succinct way:
```javascript
const capitalize = (str) => !str ? '' : `${str[0].toUpperCase()}${str.slice(1)}`;

console.log(capitalize('hello ES6')); // Output: "Hello ES6"
```

### Using Lodash
Lodash is a popular third-party utility library that offers a wide range of functions to manipulate and work with JavaScript values, including strings. To capitalize a string using Lodash:
```javascript
// First, install lodash if you haven’t: npm install lodash
const _ = require('lodash');

console.log(_.capitalize('LODASH example')); // Output: "Lodash example"
```
_Notice how Lodash not only capitalizes the first letter but also converts the rest of the string to lower case, which differs slightly from the plain JavaScript implementation._

### Using CSS (For Display Purposes Only)
If the goal is to capitalize text for displaying in the UI, CSS can be used:
```css
.capitalize {
  text-transform: capitalize;
}
```
```html
<div class="capitalize">hello css</div> <!-- Displays as "Hello css" -->
```
**Note:** This method changes how the text appears on the webpage without altering the string itself in JavaScript.
