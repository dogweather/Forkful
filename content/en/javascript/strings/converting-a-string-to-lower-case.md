## How to:
In JavaScript, we convert a string to lowercase with the `.toLowerCase()` method. It's as simple as:

```javascript
let greeting = "Hello, World!";
let lowerCaseGreeting = greeting.toLowerCase();
console.log(lowerCaseGreeting); // "hello, world!"
```

When used, each character in the original string is converted, if possible, to lowercase:

```javascript
let mixedCase = "jAvAScript ROCKs!";
let lowerCased = mixedCase.toLowerCase();
console.log(lowerCased); // "javascript rocks!"
```

Note that characters which have no lowercase equivalents remain unchanged.

## Deep Dive
In the old days, handling text meant being wary of character encodings and manual conversions. But in modern JavaScript, `.toLowerCase()` abstracts away those complexities. Underneath, it uses Unicode mappings to convert characters, so it works with more than just A-Z.

Alternative methods do exist, like:

- `toLocaleLowerCase()`: This respects the user's locale, making it essential for certain languages where the rules of lowercasing are context-specific.

- Regular expressions: Before `toLowerCase()`, developers might have used regex to replace uppercase characters manually.

Details-wise, remember `.toLowerCase()` doesn't change the original string (strings in JavaScript are immutable). You always get a new string. It also handles all characters recognized as uppercase by the Unicode standard, which means you're covered across different languages and scripts.
