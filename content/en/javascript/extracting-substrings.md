## What & Why?
Extracting substrings means grabbing a piece of a string. Programmers slice and dice strings to isolate data, input some format, or tweak text for output.

## How to:

### Using `substring` method:
```javascript
let text = "JavaScript is awesome!";
let extracted = text.substring(0, 10);
console.log(extracted); // Output: JavaScript
```

### Using `slice` method:
```javascript
let text = "JavaScript is awesome!";
let sliced = text.slice(-9, -1);
console.log(sliced); // Output: awesome
```

### Using `substr` method (deprecated):
```javascript
let text = "JavaScript is awesome!";
let substrd = text.substr(11, 7);
console.log(substrd); // Output: awesome
```

## Deep Dive
Extracting substrings isn't new – it's as old as programming itself. The `substring` and `slice` methods in JavaScript are tools from the 1990s, part of the language's initial feature set. `substr` was also in there, but it's now legacy code and should be avoided in modern applications. 

The difference? `substring` and `slice` are similar – both take start and end index parameters – but handle negatives differently: `slice` can handle negative indices, counting from the end, while `substring` treats them as zeroes. All these methods don’t mutate the original string; they produce new ones.
