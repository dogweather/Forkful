## What & Why?
Using a debugger means tapping into specialized tools that let you peek under the hood of your code, watching it run step by step. Programmers do this to squash bugs, optimize performance, and understand code behavior.

## How to:
Here's a bit of JavaScript code that's not behaving as expected:

```javascript
function buggyMultiply(a, b) {
    return a + b; // Oops! This should be a multiplication, not addition.
}

let result = buggyMultiply(5, 3);
console.log('Result:', result);
```

The output is incorrect:
```
Result: 8
```

Let’s debug in Chrome DevTools:

1. Open this JS in a browser.
2. Right-click and select "Inspect" to open DevTools.
3. Click the "Sources" tab.
4. Find your code snippet or page and put a breakpoint by clicking on the line number beside the `return` statement.
5. Refresh the page to trigger the breakpoint.
6. Check the "Scope" panel to see local variables `a` and `b`.
7. Step through with the "Step over next function call" button.
8. Spot the bug in the `return` statement.
9. Fix the code:
```javascript
function buggyMultiply(a, b) {
    return a * b; // Fixed!
}

let result = buggyMultiply(5, 3);
console.log('Result:', result);
```

The corrected output:
```
Result: 15
```

## Deep Dive
The concept of debugging has been around since the early days of computing—legend says it started when a moth was found in a computer in the 1940s! Today, JavaScript debuggers like the built-in browser tools (Chrome DevTools, Firefox Developer Tools) or IDE integrated debuggers (Visual Studio Code, WebStorm) offer a ton of features.

Alternatives to built-in debuggers include third-party tools like WebStorm or using the good-old `console.log` to output variable states. But these don't offer the real-time interaction and detailed inspection provided by debuggers.

Regarding implementation details, most debuggers work similarly: they allow you to set breakpoints that pause execution, step through code, inspect current variable states, watch expressions, and even manipulate values on the fly to test different scenarios.
