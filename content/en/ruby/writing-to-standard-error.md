## Why

In the world of programming, standard error is a crucial tool for debugging and error handling. While many developers are familiar with using standard output, writing to standard error is an essential skill to have in your coding arsenal. In this blog post, we'll take a look at why writing to standard error is important and how you can implement it in your Ruby code.

## How To

To write to standard error in Ruby, we use the `$stderr` global variable. This can be done by simply appending `.puts` to the end of the variable with the desired message inside parentheses. Let's take a look at an example:

```Ruby
$stderr.puts("Oops, something went wrong.")
```

The above code will output the message "Oops, something went wrong." to the standard error stream. This is especially useful when handling errors in your code, as it allows you to differentiate between regular output and errors.

You can also use the `$stderr` variable to redirect error messages to a file. This can be done by using the `reopen` method, like so:

```Ruby
$stderr.reopen("error_log.txt", "a")
```

The first argument specifies the file where you want to redirect the errors, and the second argument "a" specifies that we want to append new errors to the file without overwriting the existing ones.

## Deep Dive

Now that we know how to write to standard error, let's take a deeper dive into why it's important. Apart from being a helpful tool for debugging, writing to standard error can also improve the user experience of your program. Instead of abruptly crashing with a cryptic error message, users can be provided with more informative messages, allowing them to understand the issue and potentially troubleshoot it themselves.

In addition, using standard error allows other developers to easily capture and handle errors in their own programs. This is particularly useful when working on collaborative projects or open-source software, as it helps to improve the overall quality of the code.

Lastly, writing to standard error can also be used for logging purposes. By redirecting error messages to a file, developers can keep track of any issues or bugs that occur in their program, allowing them to better understand and address them in future updates.

By now, you should have a better understanding of why writing to standard error is an essential skill for Ruby developers. Remember, using standard error not only helps with debugging and error handling but also improves the overall user experience and collaboration in programming projects. So next time you encounter an error, make sure to use standard error to handle it like a pro. Happy coding!
