## What & Why?

Calculating a future or past date means finding out what the date will be, or was, after or before a specified time interval. Programmers do this for features like reminders, subscriptions, or historical data analysis.

## How to:

Ruby makes playing with dates a breeze using its built-in `Date` class and the `active_support` gem for some extra sugar. Here's how it's done:

```Ruby
require 'date'
require 'active_support/core_ext/integer'

# Get today's date
today = Date.today
puts "Today is: #{today}"

# Calculate a date 10 days in the future
future_date = today + 10
puts "10 days from now will be: #{future_date}"

# Calculate a date 30 days in the past
past_date = today - 30
puts "30 days ago it was: #{past_date}"

# More complex calculations with active_support
puts "In 2 months, it will be: #{2.months.from_now.to_date}"
puts "100 days ago, it was: #{100.days.ago.to_date}"
```

Sample output:

```
Today is: 2023-04-07
10 days from now will be: 2023-04-17
30 days ago it was: 2023-03-08
In 2 months, it will be: 2023-06-07
100 days ago, it was: 2022-12-28
```

## Deep Dive

Before Ruby absorbed date calculation functionalities into its standard and additional libraries, developers often had to manually calculate dates, considering leap years, different month lengths, and time zonesâ€”quite the headache.

The standard `Date` class does a lot out of the box. You can add (`+`) or subtract (`-`) days easily. However, for more intuitive time period manipulations, like "2 months from now", we rely on `active_support`, extracted from Ruby on Rails. This gem uses extensions to standard Ruby classes, making such calculations human-friendly.

When calculating past or future dates, consider time zones if you're also factoring in times (`DateTime` or `Time` objects). Ruby's `Time` class and `active_support` can handle this but require a bit more setup.

Alternatives exist, like the `time-lord` and `ice_cube` gems, offering more syntactic sugar or specialized features (like recurring events), respectively.
