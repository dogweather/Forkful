## What & Why? 

Interpolation is a method of injecting values directly into a string. It makes it easy to insert variables or computed values into a text in Ruby â€” saving programmers from fumbling with string concatenation.

## How to

String interpolation in Ruby looks like this:

```Ruby 
name = "Ruby"
puts "Hello, #{name}!"
```

The output would be:

```
Hello, Ruby!
```

You can also inject code. Consider that we need to calculate a total price:

```Ruby
quantity = 10
price_per_item = 2.5
puts "Total price is #{quantity * price_per_item}"
```

And the output:

```
Total price is 25.0
```

## Deep Dive 

String interpolation was introduced in Ruby 1.9, replacing the older and more verbose `sprintf` formatting approach. 

An alternative to interpolation is concatenation, but beware, interpolation often reads more easily. Compare these two pieces of code:

```Ruby
puts "Hello, " + name + "!"  # Concatenation 
puts "Hello, #{name}!"       # Interpolation
```

When interpolating, Ruby executes the code inside the curly braces and converts the result to a string. It's handy, but keep in mind your string cannot perform heavy computations or complex object manipulations.
