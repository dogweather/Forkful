## What & Why?
Downloading a web page means grabbing the HTML content from the internet. Programmers do it to parse the data, scrape information, or monitor changes programmatically.

## How to:
Ruby makes downloading a web page straightforward with libraries like `net/http` and gems like `open-uri`. Here's how to do it using `net/http`:

```Ruby
require 'net/http'
require 'uri'

url = URI.parse('http://example.com') 
response = Net::HTTP.get_response(url)

puts response.body if response.is_a?(Net::HTTPSuccess)
```

You'll get the HTML content of `http://example.com` printed out.

Using `open-uri` is even simpler:

```Ruby
require 'open-uri'

downloaded_page = URI.open('http://example.com').read
puts downloaded_page
```

Again, the web page content is displayed on your terminal.

## Deep Dive
Back in the early days of the web, downloading a page was a bit more labor-intensive, involving manual HTTP request crafting. Today, Ruby abstracts much of that complexity away.

Alternatives to `net/http` and `open-uri` include higher-level gems like `HTTParty` and `RestClient`. They offer more features and an object-oriented approach. For heavy-duty web scraping, many Rubyists turn to `Nokogiri` to parse HTML or `Mechanize` which acts like a web browser.

When it comes to implementation, keep in mind that `open-uri` is a wrapper for `net/http`, so it's pretty convenient but may lack some low-level control. `net/http` gives you more control over the request but can be verbose for simple tasks.
