## What & Why?
Capitalizing a string often means converting the first character of a string to uppercase **and the rest to lowercase**. But sometimes it can mean just making sure that the first character is uppercase while leaving the rest of the string unchanged. Honestly, it's a vague term, in my opinion.

## How to:
Ruby provides straightforward methods for string manipulation, including capitalization:

```ruby
# Ruby's built-in method
string = "hello world"
capitalized_string = string.capitalize
puts capitalized_string # => "Hello world"
```

Ruby's `.capitalize` method is convenient but only affects the first letter. For more control or to capitalize each word in a string (known as title case), you might want to use the `titleize` method from the Rails ActiveSupport extension, or implement it yourself:

```ruby
# Using ActiveSupport's 'titleize' in Rails
require 'active_support/core_ext/string/inflections'
string = "hello world"
puts string.titleize # => "Hello World"
```

If you're not using Rails or prefer a pure Ruby solution, hereâ€™s how you might capitalize each word in a string:

```ruby
string = "hello world"
capitalized_each_word = string.split.map(&:capitalize).join(' ')
puts capitalized_each_word # => "Hello World"
```

This method splits the string into an array of words, capitalizes each one, then joins them back together with a space.
