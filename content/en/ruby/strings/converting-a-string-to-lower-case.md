## How to:
```ruby
# Using the downcase method
my_string = "Hello World!"
puts my_string.downcase  # => "hello world!"
```

```ruby
# Using downcase! for in-place transformation
my_string = "Hello World!"
my_string.downcase!
puts my_string           # => "hello world!"
```

## Deep Dive
Historically, case conversion has been a staple in programming languages to ensure text uniformity. It supports case-insensitive comparisons and searches, hence its importance.

The `downcase` and `downcase!` methods in Ruby stem from the language's principle of providing both non-destructive and destructive methods for string manipulation. The non-destructive `downcase` returns a new string, leaving the original untouched, while the destructive `downcase!` modifies the original string in place, which can be more memory efficient.

There are alternatives for cases when locale-specific rules apply. `String#mb_chars` combined with `ActiveSupport::Multibyte::Chars#downcase` from the Rails ActiveSupport library can handle more complex situations like characters with accents or other diacritical marks:
```ruby
require 'active_support/core_ext/string/multibyte'

my_string = "ÄÖÜ"
puts my_string.mb_chars.downcase  # => "äöü"
```

As for implementation, Ruby's `downcase` and `downcase!` internally use Unicode mapping to convert each character of the string to its lowercase equivalent.
