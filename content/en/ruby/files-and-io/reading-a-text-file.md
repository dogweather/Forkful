## How to:
Reading a file in Ruby is straightforward. You can use the `File` class, which provides different methods to read files. Here's a simple example of reading an entire file:

```Ruby
File.open("example.txt", "r") do |file|
  puts file.read
end
```

If `example.txt` contains the text "Hello, Ruby!", here's what you'll get:

```
Hello, Ruby!
```

For reading line by line:

```Ruby
File.foreach("example.txt") { |line| puts line }
```

Same `example.txt`, now output will be line by line:

```
Hello, Ruby!
```

## Deep Dive:
Historically, reading files has been a core feature of programming languages, allowing interactions with the filesystem.

In Ruby, you can also read a file with different tools:

1. `IO` class: For low-level file operations.
2. `readlines` method: Loads the entire file into an array, with each line as an element.
3. `File.read`: Quick way to read an entire file into a string.

There's a trade-off to consider: `File.read` is neat for small files, but it can be memory intensive for larger ones. That's when reading line by line or in chunks becomes valuable.
