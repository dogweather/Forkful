title: Getting the current date

## How to:
Ruby's standard library includes the `Date` and `Time` classes for handling dates and time. Here's how to get the current date:

```ruby
require 'date'

current_date = Date.today
puts current_date
```

Sample output: 
```
2023-04-12
```

For including time with the date, Ruby's `Time` class is more suitable:

```ruby
current_time = Time.now
puts current_time
```

Sample output: 
```
2023-04-12 14:33:07 +0200
```

If you need more functionality, such as time zone management, you might want to use a third-party gem like `ActiveSupport` (part of Rails but can be used standalone).

First, add `activesupport` to your Gemfile and run `bundle install`:

```ruby
gem 'activesupport'
```

Then, use it to handle time zones:

```ruby
require 'active_support/time'

Time.zone = 'Eastern Time (US & Canada)'  # Set your desired time zone
current_time_with_zone = Time.zone.now
puts current_time_with_zone
```

Sample output:
```
Wed, 12 Apr 2023 08:33:07 EDT -04:00
```
