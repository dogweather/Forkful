## What & Why?

Writing tests checks if code works as expected. Programmers do it to catch bugs early, ensure reliability, and ease future code changes.

## How to:

Ruby uses Minitest and RSpec for testingâ€”let's use RSpec. First, install it:

```ruby
gem install rspec
```

Create a test file, `calculator_spec.rb`:

```ruby
RSpec.describe Calculator do
  describe "#add" do
    it "sums two numbers" do
      expect(Calculator.new.add(3, 7)).to eql(10)
    end
  end
end
```

Run the test with:

```shell
rspec calculator_spec.rb
```

Output:

```
F

Failures:

  1) Calculator#add sums two numbers
     Failure/Error: expect(Calculator.new.add(3, 7)).to eql(10)
     
     NameError:
       uninitialized constant Calculator
```

Create `calculator.rb`:

```ruby
class Calculator
  def add(a, b)
    a + b
  end
end
```

Run tests again.

Output:

```

## Deep Dive

Testing in Ruby goes back to Test::Unit, but RSpec, introduced in 2005, revolutionized Ruby testing with "behavior-driven development". Alternatives to RSpec include Minitest and Test::Unit. RSpec focuses on readability and the business side; Minitest is more minimalist and faster. Typically, tests mimic software use, checking functions, data, and edge cases. For existing projects, start by testing the most critical parts.
