## What & Why?
In Ruby, creating a temporary file helps protect sensitive data and manage fleeting storage needs. Programmers use it for secure, short-term file handling that avoids cluttering up the filesystem.

## How to:
Ruby's standard library provides `Tempfile` for creating temporary files. Let's dive right in:

```Ruby
require 'tempfile'

Tempfile.create('my_temp') do |tempfile|
  tempfile.write('Temporary content')
  puts "Temporary file is located at: #{tempfile.path}"
end
# After the block, the file is automatically deleted.
```

Once you run this, you'll see:

```
Temporary file is located at: /tmp/my_temp20180418-56789-1234567
```

This file won't stick around longer than needed. As soon as the block ends, Ruby cleans up for you.

## Deep Dive
The `Tempfile` class has been around since Ruby 1.8, practiced and polished over time. Under the hood, it uses your system's temporary file path, offered by the operating system. 

Alternatives? Sure, you could manually create and track temp files, but why reinvent the wheel? `Tempfile` gives you a random, unique filename, reducing the risk of collisions. 

For those hankering after more control, the `Tempfile.new` method takes parameters for tweaking file name and location. But remember, with great power comes great responsibility - you'll need to delete these files manually.

The real edge of using `Tempfile` lies in its thread-safe and garbage-collected nature. It locks the file down and ensures that sensitive data doesn't linger longer than it should. A temporary file behaves much like a standard File object, so you can read from, write to, and otherwise manipulate it using typical file operations.
