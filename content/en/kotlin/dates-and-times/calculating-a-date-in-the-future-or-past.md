## How to:
Kotlin handles dates and times with the `java.time` library. To add or subtract days, use `plusDays()` or `minusDays()`. Here's the skinny:

```kotlin
import java.time.LocalDate

fun main() {
    val today = LocalDate.now()
    val tenDaysLater = today.plusDays(10)
    val tenDaysBefore = today.minusDays(10)
    
    println("Today: $today")
    println("Ten days from now: $tenDaysLater")
    println("Ten days ago: $tenDaysBefore")
}
```

Sample output:

```
Today: 2023-03-15
Ten days from now: 2023-03-25
Ten days ago: 2023-03-05
```

Beyond days, you can also play with months and years (`plusMonths()`, `minusMonths()`, `plusYears()`, `minusYears()`).

## Deep Dive
Calculating dates isn't new. Since Java 8, the `java.time` package has been the go-to for date-time arithmeticâ€”much better than old `Calendar` or `Date`, which were clunky and not thread-safe. 

`java.time` uses immutable objects, so you avoid nasty bugs from accidentally modifying your dates. Objects like `LocalDate`, `LocalTime`, `LocalDateTime`, and `ZonedDateTime` help you represent different aspects of time precisely.

Alternatives? Of course. Before `java.time`, Joda-Time was the weapon of choice. Some older systems still use it. And in the Android realm, the ThreeTenABP library backports `java.time` features for compatibility with Java 6 & 7 circumstances.

The `java.time` API is also designed to be timezone-aware, thanks to classes like `ZonedDateTime`. So when you're shimmying dates around, you can respect the chronology of Earth's spin.
