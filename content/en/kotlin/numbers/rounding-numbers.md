## What & Why?

Rounding numbers means adjusting them to the nearest whole number or to a specified degree of precision. Programmers do it to improve readability, reduce storage requirements, or because the exact value isn't critical for subsequent calculations.

## How to:

In Kotlin, rounding can be done using several functions like `roundToInt()`, `roundToDouble()`, and using `BigDecimal` for more control:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val number1 = 3.14159
    println(number1.roundToInt()) // Outputs: 3

    val number2 = 3.5
    println(number2.roundToInt()) // Outputs: 4

    val number3 = 123.456
    println("%.2f".format(number3)) // Outputs: 123.46
    
    val bigDecimal = number3.toBigDecimal().setScale(1, RoundingMode.HALF_EVEN)
    println(bigDecimal) // Outputs: 123.5
}
```

## Deep Dive

Historically, rounding numbers has been a fundamental concept in both mathematics and computation, designed to handle numerical precision limitations. In early computing, rounding was critical due to the high cost of memory.

In Kotlin, rounding is built upon the standard Java libraries. Options for rounding include `Math.round()`, which rounds to the nearest whole number, and `BigDecimal` for customizable rounding, where you can specify a scale and a `RoundingMode`. 

Each `RoundingMode` has different policies for handling ties (when the digit is exactly in the middle of the options for rounding). For instance, `RoundingMode.HALF_UP` rounds to the nearest neighbor, unless both neighbors are equidistant, in which case it rounds up.
