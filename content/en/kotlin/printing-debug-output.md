## Why 

Debugging is a crucial part of any programming process. It helps us identify and fix any errors or bugs in our code. However, sometimes it can be difficult to understand where the error lies, especially in large and complex code bases. This is where printing debug output comes in handy. By printing specific information or values at certain points in our code, we can get a better understanding of how our code is executing and what values are being passed around. This can greatly aid in the debugging process and ultimately save us time and effort. 

## How To 

To print debug output in Kotlin, we can use the `println()` or `print()` functions. These functions take in a string as a parameter and print it to the console. We can also use string interpolation to easily print out variable values. For example:

```Kotlin
val name = "John"
val age = 25
println("Name: $name, Age: $age")
```

This will print out `Name: John, Age: 25` to the console. We can also use these functions within conditional statements or loops to print out specific values at different points in our code. 

## Deep Dive 

There are a few things to keep in mind when printing debug output. First, it's important to only print out relevant information. Printing out too much can clutter the console and make it difficult to find the information we need. Second, we can use the `Log` class from the Kotlin standard library to print out debug output to log files instead of the console. This can be useful when debugging on a production server. We can also use the `assert()` function to print out debug output that only runs during debugging and not in a production environment. Lastly, remember to remove any debug output before deploying your code to a production environment to avoid cluttering the codebase and potential security risks.
