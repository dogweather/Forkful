## What & Why?

Comparing two dates means checking whether one comes before or after the other, or if they're the same moment in time. Programmers do this for tasks like sorting events, scheduling, and checking durations between dates.

## How to:

```Kotlin
import java.time.LocalDate

fun main() {
    val date1 = LocalDate.of(2023, 4, 10)
    val date2 = LocalDate.of(2023, 5, 15)

    println(date1.isBefore(date2))  // true
    println(date1.isAfter(date2))   // false
    println(date1.isEqual(date2))   // false

    // Comparing using compareTo
    println(date1.compareTo(date2)) // -1 if date1 is before date2
}
```

Sample output:

```
true
false
false
-1
```

## Deep Dive

Historically, Java provided `Date` and `Calendar` classes but they weren't very user-friendly. Kotlin uses similar classes under the hood but encourages using the `java.time` package introduced in Java 8 for better clarity and utility.

There are alternatives like `Instant` for timestamps, `ZonedDateTime` for time-zone specific dates, or using a third-party library like Joda-Time. Keep implementation details in mindâ€”`Instant` uses a traditional Unix timestamp while `LocalDate` abstracts this away and deals with a conceptual day without time or timezone.

Knowing which class best suits your needs is essential. `LocalDate` is fine for most date comparisons, but for precise instant-in-time comparisons, consider `ZonedDateTime` or `Instant`.
