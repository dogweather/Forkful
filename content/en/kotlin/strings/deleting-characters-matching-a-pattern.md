## What & Why?

Deleting characters that match a pattern is about finding and removing specific sequences of characters in a string based on rules (the pattern). Programmers do it to clean up data, parse content, or manipulate text to meet certain conditions.

## How to:

Here's how you can delete characters matching a pattern in Kotlin, using a simple regex pattern.

```Kotlin
fun main() {
    var text = "Hello, 123 World! This is a regex 456 example."

    // Define a pattern to match digits
    val pattern = "\\d+".toRegex()

    // Replace digits with an empty string
    val cleanedText = pattern.replace(text, "")

    println(cleanedText)  // Output: "Hello,  World! This is a regex  example."
}
```
Sample output:
```
Hello,  World! This is a regex  example.
```

## Deep Dive

Back in the days before languages like Kotlin, pattern matching could be a laborious task, involving loops, conditionals, and character-by-character inspection. With Kotlin and regular expressions (regex), the task becomes much simpler.

Regex is all about pattern recognition in text. It's been a part of computer science since the 1950s and became a staple with the advent of Perl in the 1980s. Kotlin's implementation of regex is inherited from Java's `java.util.regex` package, ensuring a mature and robust pattern matching capability.

Alternatives to regex include manual string manipulation, using substring operations, and character arrays, but these are often more verbose and error-prone. While regex can be slower for simple tasks because of its complexity, for most pattern matching, it's the go-to solution due to its flexibility and conciseness.

As for implementation details, Kotlin's `replace` method in the `Regex` class uses a `Matcher` internally, iterating over the input string to find subsequences that match the pattern and replacing them with a given replacement string.

One must be cautious when dealing with regex, specially with complex patterns, as it can lead to performance issues â€” commonly referred to as "catastrophic backtracking". But for most practical uses, it's a powerful tool in the programmer's toolkit.
