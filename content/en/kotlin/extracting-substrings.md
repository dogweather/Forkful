## What & Why?
Extracting substrings means pulling out specific parts from a string. We do it to manipulate or analyze text data, like grabbing usernames from email addresses or slicing dates to get the month.

## How to:
In Kotlin, use `substring`, `take`, and `drop` functions.

```Kotlin
fun main() {
    val text = "Hello, Kotlin!"

    println(text.substring(7, 13)) // Prints "Kotlin"
    
    // From start
    println(text.take(5)) // Prints "Hello"

    // From end
    println(text.takeLast(6)) // Prints "Kotlin!"

    // Dropping chars
    println(text.drop(7)) // Prints "Kotlin!"
}
```

## Deep Dive
In the early days of programming, handling strings was manual and error-prone. In Kotlin, it's easier, safer, and less resource-intensive, thanks to built-in functions and String class features.

Alternatives to `substring` include using regular expressions with `Regex` or `split` to dice up stringsâ€”but these methods can be overkill for simple tasks.

Implementation-wise, remember that strings are immutable in Kotlin. So, when you extract a substring, you're actually creating a new String object, not changing the original.
