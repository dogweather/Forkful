summary: Organizing code into functions in Dart is about defining reusable blocks
  of code that perform specific tasks, typically receiving inputs, processing data,
  and possibly returning outputs.

## How to:


### Basic Function
In Dart, you define a function using the `void` keyword if it doesn't return a value, or specify the type of value it returns otherwise. Here's a simple function that prints a greeting message:

```dart
void greet(String name) {
  print('Hello, $name!');
}

void main() {
  greet('Alice');  // Output: Hello, Alice!
}
```

### Returning a Value
Functions can return values. The following example takes two integers as input and returns their sum:

```dart
int add(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}

void main() {
  var sum = add(5, 3);
  print(sum);  // Output: 8
}
```

### Anonymous Functions
Dart supports anonymous functions (also known as lambda expressions or closures), which can be handy for short, on-the-fly functionalities. Here's how to use an anonymous function with a list's `forEach` method:

```dart
void main() {
  var fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];
  fruits.forEach((item) {
    print(item);
  });
  // Output:
  // apple
  // banana
  // cherry
}
```

### Arrow Syntax for Single-Expression Functions
For functions that only contain a single expression, Dart offers a concise syntax using the "arrow" notation (`=>`). This is especially useful for short functions or passing functions as arguments:

```dart
int square(int num) => num * num;

void main() {
  print(square(4));  // Output: 16
}
```

### Using Third-Party Libraries
For more complex or specialized functionalities, Dart programmers often rely on third-party libraries. Consider the `http` library for making HTTP requests. First, add `http` to your pubspec.yaml file under dependencies:

```
dependencies:
  http: ^0.13.3
```

Then, you can use it to fetch data from the web:

```dart
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

Future<void> fetchUserData() async {
  var response = await http.get(Uri.parse('https://api.example.com/users/1'));
  print(response.body);
}

void main() {
  fetchUserData();
  // Expected output: JSON data of the user. Actual output will depend on the API's response.
}
```

Remember, when organizing your Dart code into functions, think about reusability, clarity, and the single responsibility principle. This not only makes your code cleaner but also easier for others (and future you) to understand and maintain.
