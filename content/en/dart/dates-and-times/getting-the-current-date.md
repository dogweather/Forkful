## How to:
Dart's core library provides straightforward access to the current date and time through the `DateTime` class. Here's the basic example to get the current date:

```dart
void main() {
  DateTime now = DateTime.now();
  print(now); // Example output: 2023-04-12 10:00:00.000
}
```

If you only need the date part (year, month, day), you can format the `DateTime` object:

```dart
void main() {
  DateTime now = DateTime.now();
  String formattedDate = "${now.year}-${now.month}-${now.day}";
  print(formattedDate); // Example output: 2023-04-12
}
```

Dart doesn't include a built-in library for more complex date formatting, but you can use the `intl` package for this purpose. First, add the package to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  intl: ^0.17.0
```

Then, you can format dates easily:

```dart
import 'package:intl/intl.dart';

void main() {
  DateTime now = DateTime.now();
  String formattedDate = DateFormat('yyyy-MM-dd').format(now);
  print(formattedDate); // Example output: 2023-04-12
}
```

For more advanced formatting options, explore the `DateFormat` class provided by the `intl` package, which supports a wide range of patterns and locales.
