## How to:
Dart provides robust support for date manipulation through its `DateTime` class. Here's how you can calculate future or past dates using native Dart, without needing third-party libraries.

### Calculating a Future Date
To calculate a date in the future, you create a `DateTime` object and use the `add` method with the desired duration.

```dart
DateTime today = DateTime.now();
Duration tenDays = Duration(days: 10);
DateTime futureDate = today.add(tenDays);

print(futureDate); // Output: 2023-04-21 14:22:35.123456 (example output, depends on current date and time)
```

### Calculating a Past Date
For calculating a date in the past, you use the `subtract` method on a `DateTime` object with the necessary duration.

```dart
DateTime today = DateTime.now();
Duration fifteenDaysAgo = Duration(days: 15);
DateTime pastDate = today.subtract(fifteenDaysAgo);

print(pastDate); // Output: 2023-03-27 14:22:35.123456 (example output, depends on current date and time)
```

### Using Third-Party Libraries
Though Dart's native capabilities for date manipulation are powerful, you might find yourself needing more specific operations, like parsing or formatting dates more easily, or performing complex calculations. In such cases, the `time` package can be highly useful.

First, add `time` to your `pubspec.yaml` dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  time: ^2.0.0
```

Then, you can use it to perform similar calculations with enhanced readability:

```dart
import 'package:time/time.dart';

void main() {
  DateTime today = DateTime.now();

  // Calculating a future date
  DateTime futureDate = today + 10.days;
  print(futureDate); // Output format: 2023-04-21 14:22:35.123456

  // Calculating a past date
  DateTime pastDate = today - 15.days;
  print(pastDate); // Output format: 2023-03-27 14:22:35.123456
}
```

These examples illustrate basic date manipulations in Dart, including adding and subtracting time to or from a current date, demonstrating how effortlessly dates can be managed in Dart applications.
