## How to:
In Dart, string interpolation is straightforward, utilizing the `$` symbol to interpolate expressions directly within string literals:

```dart
void main() {
  String name = 'Dart';
  int year = 2023;
  // Simple variable interpolation
  print('Learning $name in $year!');
  // Output: Learning Dart in 2023!
  
  // Interpolating expressions
  print('In two years, it will be ${year + 2}.');
  // Output: In two years, it will be 2025.
}
```

In the case where you have more complex expressions or want to perform operations within the string itself, enclose the expression in `${}`. Dart doesn't have any popular third-party libraries specifically for string interpolation as it's well equipped natively to handle varied and complex scenarios.
