## What & Why?

String interpolation is the process of injecting variable values directly into strings, often for creating meaningful messages without cumbersome concatenations. Programmers do it for cleaner, more readable code and to prevent errors prone to happen in complex string concatenations.

## How to:

In Dart, string interpolation is straightforward, utilizing the `$` symbol to interpolate expressions directly within string literals:

```dart
void main() {
  String name = 'Dart';
  int year = 2023;
  // Simple variable interpolation
  print('Learning $name in $year!');
  // Output: Learning Dart in 2023!
  
  // Interpolating expressions
  print('In two years, it will be ${year + 2}.');
  // Output: In two years, it will be 2025.
}
```

In the case where you have more complex expressions or want to perform operations within the string itself, enclose the expression in `${}`. Dart doesn't have any popular third-party libraries specifically for string interpolation as it's well equipped natively to handle varied and complex scenarios.
