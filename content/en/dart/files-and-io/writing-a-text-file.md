## How to:
Dart's core library provides the `dart:io` package for file handling, allowing you to write text files without the need for third-party libraries. Here's a simple example of writing a text file:

```dart
import 'dart:io';

void main() async {
  // Create a new file named 'example.txt' in the current directory.
  var file = File('example.txt');
  
  // Write a string to the file.
  await file.writeAsString('Hello, Dart!');
  
  // Verify the contents.
  print(await file.readAsString()); // Output: Hello, Dart!
}
```

When dealing with larger files or streams of data, you might prefer writing content using `openWrite` which returns an `IOSink` and allows you to write data in chunks:

```dart
import 'dart:io';

void main() async {
  var file = File('large_file.txt');
  var sink = file.openWrite();

  // Write multiple lines to the file.
  sink
    ..writeln('Line 1: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.')
    ..writeln('Line 2: Dart is awesome!')
    ..close();

  // Wait for the sink to close to ensure all data is written to the file.
  await sink.done;

  // Read and print file content to verify
  print(await file.readAsString());
}
```

For more advanced file operations, including appending to files or writing bytes, you may delve deeper into the `File` class methods provided by `dart:io`. Additionally, when working on large scale or more complex projects, considering packages like `path` for dealing with file paths or `shelf` for web server functionalities might be beneficial, though direct file writing typically relies on the built-in Dart libraries.
