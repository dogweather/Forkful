## What & Why?

Reading a text file in Dart involves accessing and retrieving data from files stored on the file system. Programmers do this to handle input data, configuration settings, or read datasets, making it a fundamental operation for many applications ranging from simple scripts to complex apps.

## How to:

Dartâ€™s core library, `dart:io`, provides the necessary functionalities to read text files synchronously or asynchronously. Here's how to approach both.

**Synchronously:**

```dart
import 'dart:io';

void main() {
  var fileName = "path/to/your/textfile.txt";
  var file = File(fileName);

  // Reading the file synchronously
  var contents;
  try {
    contents = file.readAsStringSync();
    print(contents);
  } catch (e) {
    print('Error reading file: $e');
  }
}
```

**Asynchronously:**

To avoid blocking the program while the file is being read, especially useful for large files or responsive applications:

```dart
import 'dart:io';

void main() async {
  var fileName = "path/to/your/textfile.txt";
  var file = File(fileName);

  try {
    String contents = await file.readAsString();
    print(contents);
  } catch (e) {
    print('Error reading file: $e');
  }
}
```

**Sample Output:**

If your text file contains:

```
Hello, Dart!
```

Both of the above methods will output:

```
Hello, Dart!
```

**Using a Third-Party Library:**

For additional features like simplified file operations or enhanced error handling, you might consider third-party libraries such as `package:file`. However, as of my last update, using the core `dart:io` package directly, as shown above, is the most common and straightforward method for reading text files in Dart.
