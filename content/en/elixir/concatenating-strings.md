## What & Why?

Concatenating strings is the process of joining two or more strings end-to-end to form a new string. We do it to dynamically create sentences, content, or data.

## How to:

In Elixir, we concatenate strings with the `<>` operator. Check this out:

```elixir
name = "Charlie"
greeting = "Hello, " <> name <> "!"
IO.puts greeting
```

The output you'll see is:

```elixir
"Hello, Charlie!"
```

Easy, right? Strings are just glued together in the order you stake them.

## Deep Dive

In the past, Elixir employed concatenation method similar to other languages like JavaScript (`+` operator) or Python (`join` function). However, it now uses the `<>` operator, unique, and more explicit.

Are there alternatives? Well, you could use `String.concat/2` or `String.concat/1` from the built-in String module. But the `<>` operator is faster owing to being a compiler directive.

Why is this important? Concatenation might seem trivial, but itâ€™s frequently used in creating dynamic content, merging pieces of text from different sources, etc. Since Elixir is an immutable language, every concatenation operation creates a new string. Knowing these details helps you manage memory better and write more efficient code.
