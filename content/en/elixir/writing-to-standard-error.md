## What & Why?

Writing to standard error (`stderr`) is outputting text thatâ€™s not part of the main program data but indicates errors or diagnostics. Programmers do it to debug and log issues without cluttering the standard output (`stdout`), which is often reserved for program's result data.

## How to:

To write to `stderr` in Elixir, use `IO.warn/1` or `IO.puts/2`. Here's how:

```elixir
# Write to stderr with IO.warn
IO.warn("Something went wrong!")

# Write to stderr with IO.puts
IO.puts(:stderr, "Detailed error information.")
```

Sample output to `stderr`:

```
Something went wrong!
Detailed error information.
```

## Deep Dive

Historically, separating `stderr` from `stdout` allowed Unix users to handle error messages distinctly from regular output, which could be especially useful when redirecting output to a file or another program.

Elixir, being a modern language, maintains this tradition. While `IO.puts/1` defaults to `stdout`, passing the `:stderr` atom as the first argument switches the stream. `IO.warn/1` writes to `stderr` by default, which suits warning messages.

Alternatives for error logging in Elixir might include the Logger module for a more structured approach. This can be configured to write logs of various levels to `stderr`.

Under the hood, Elixir's IO functions for stderr and stdout interact with Erlang's :io module, which in turn works with the underlying operating system's I/O streams.
