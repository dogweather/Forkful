## What & Why?
Working with XML in Elixir means parsing, creating, and manipulating XML data. Programmers tackle XML because it's widespread in web services, config files, and legacy systems.

## How to:
Elixir doesn't include XML parsing in its standard library. SweetXML is a popular choice. Here's how to use it:

```elixir
# Add SweetXML to your dependencies in mix.exs
{:sweet_xml, "~> 0.6"}

# In your code
import SweetXml

xml = """
<note>
  <to>Tove</to>
  <from>Jani</from>
  <heading>Reminder</heading>
  <body>Don't forget me this weekend!</body>
</note>
"""

# Parse XML
note = xml |> xpath(~x"//note")
to = xml |> xpath(~x"//note/to" |> inner_text())
IO.puts to # Output: Tove
```

## Deep Dive
XML, or Extensible Markup Language, has been around since the late 90s. It's verbose but structuredâ€”ideal for complex data interchange. While JSON's popularity soared for its simplicity, XML remains entrenched in many enterprise and financial systems for its expressiveness and standardized schemas.

Alternatives include:
- JSON for lighter, less verbose data exchange.
- Protobuf or Thrift for binary serialized data communication, particularly for internal systems.

Under the hood, XML libraries for Elixir leverage Erlang's :xmerl library for parsing, which provides robust support but can be less intuitive than more modern approaches. As Elixir evolves, community-driven libraries like SweetXML wrap these with a more Elixir-esque syntax, making XML manipulations more accessible.
