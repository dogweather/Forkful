## What & Why?

Printing debug output is a means of examining your Elixir program as it runs, displaying values and states of elements to the console for inspection. Itâ€™s crucial during development or debugging as it helps to understand the actual sequence of code execution or to check some values/classes/structures during the runtime.

## How To:

Elixir provides several methods for debug output, the most common ones are `IO.puts/2` and `IO.inspect/2`. Here is an example:

```Elixir
x = 5
IO.puts("The value of x is #{x}")
```
```Output
The value of x is 5
```
`IO.puts/2` prints the argument given to the standard output.

```Elixir
list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
IO.inspect(list)
```
```Output
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
`IO.inspect/2` can be even more valuable as it can handle more complex data types, printing a detailed, readable output of your data's structure.

## Deep Dive

Originally with roots in Erlang, Elixir brings along the `io` module from its parent language. While it may not seem as fancy as integrated development environment (IDE) debuggers, in-place printing has value in its simplicity and directness. 

There are alternatives to directly printing to the console, for instance, using Elixir's powerful tracing and debugging tools like `:debugger` module or libraries like `:observer`. These tools allow for stepping through code and inspecting program state at different points of execution, offering a deeper but more complex approach.

Using `IO.inspect/2` directly modifies the codebase which might not be the best practice. One preferred approach is to use a logging library, like `Logger`, that won't interfere with production code and offers various options for output format and destination.
