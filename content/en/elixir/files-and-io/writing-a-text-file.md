## What & Why?

Writing to a text file in Elixir is an essential skill for developers, allowing for data persistence, logging, or exporting human-readable content. Programmers accomplish this to save application state, debug information, configurations, or any data exchange between systems that prefer a ubiquitous format like text.

## How to:

Elixir makes file handling straightforward with built-in modules. The primary way to write to a file is using the `File.write/2` or `File.write!/2` functions, where the former returns an `:ok` or `:error` tuple and the latter raises an error on failure. 

Here's a simple example:

```elixir
# Writing to a file, simple message
File.write("hello.txt", "Hello, World!")

# When you run the code, it creates 'hello.txt' with "Hello, World!" as content
```

For appending to files, you'd use `File.open/3` with the `[:write, :append]` options, then `IO.binwrite/2` to append the content:

```elixir
# Appending to a file
{:ok, file} = File.open("hello.txt", [:write, :append])
IO.binwrite(file, "\nLet's add another line.")
File.close(file)

# Now 'hello.txt' includes a second line "Let's add another line."
```

If you're working with large data or need more control over the writing process, you might use the `Stream` module to lazily write data to the file:

```elixir
# Writing a large dataset lazily
stream_data = Stream.iterate(0, &(&1 + 1))
            |> Stream.map(&("Number: #{&1}\n"))
            |> Stream.take(10)

File.open!("numbers.txt", [:write], fn file ->
  Enum.each(stream_data, fn line ->
    IO.write(file, line)
  end)
end)

# This creates 'numbers.txt', writing numbers 0 to 9, each on a new line.
```

For projects that require more sophisticated file handling, you might look into third-party libraries like `CSV`, which offers tailored functionalities for CSV file manipulation but remember, for many purposes, Elixir's built-in capabilities are more than sufficient.
