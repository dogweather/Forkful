## What & Why?

Writing to standard error (stderr) in Elixir is a method of directing error messages and diagnostics separate from the main output (stdout). Programmers use stderr to debug and handle errors without cluttering the program's main output, making it easier to identify and address issues.

## How to:

In Elixir, you can use `IO` module functions such as `IO.puts/2` and `IO.warn/2` to write messages to standard error:

```elixir
# Writing a simple message to stderr
IO.puts(:stderr, "Error: Something went wrong!")

# Using IO.warn, which is more semantic for warnings/errors
IO.warn("Warning: You are about to exceed the limit!")
```

Sample output in the terminal for `IO.puts/2`:
```
Error: Something went wrong!
```

For `IO.warn/2`, the output would be similar, but `IO.warn/2` is specifically designed for warnings and might include additional formatting or behavior in future Elixir versions.

**Using Third-Party Libraries**

While Elixir's standard library is usually sufficient for handling standard error output, you might find libraries like `Logger` useful for more complex applications or for configuring different log levels and outputs.

Example using `Logger` to output an error message:

```elixir
require Logger

# Configure Logger to output to stderr
Logger.configure_backend(:console, device: :stderr)

# Writing an error message
Logger.error("Error: Failed to connect to the database.")
```

This setup directs the `Logger`'s output specifically to stderr, which is useful for separating error logging from standard log messages.
