summary: Writing to standard error (stderr) in Elixir is a method of directing error
  messages and diagnostics separate from the main output (stdout).

## How to:
In Elixir, you can use `IO` module functions such as `IO.puts/2` and `IO.warn/2` to write messages to standard error:

```elixir
# Writing a simple message to stderr
IO.puts(:stderr, "Error: Something went wrong!")

# Using IO.warn, which is more semantic for warnings/errors
IO.warn("Warning: You are about to exceed the limit!")
```

Sample output in the terminal for `IO.puts/2`:
```
Error: Something went wrong!
```

For `IO.warn/2`, the output would be similar, but `IO.warn/2` is specifically designed for warnings and might include additional formatting or behavior in future Elixir versions.

**Using Third-Party Libraries**

While Elixir's standard library is usually sufficient for handling standard error output, you might find libraries like `Logger` useful for more complex applications or for configuring different log levels and outputs.

Example using `Logger` to output an error message:

```elixir
require Logger

# Configure Logger to output to stderr
Logger.configure_backend(:console, device: :stderr)

# Writing an error message
Logger.error("Error: Failed to connect to the database.")
```

This setup directs the `Logger`'s output specifically to stderr, which is useful for separating error logging from standard log messages.
