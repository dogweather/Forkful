# Get Current Date in Elixir: Riding the Time Machine

## What & Why?

Getting the current date is simply retrieving the present dayâ€™s information (year, month, day) in the system timezone. Coders do it when building features such as event logging, time tracking, or date stamping records.

## How to:

In Elixir, you use the `DateTime` module to get the current date. Here's how you do it:

```elixir
DateTime.utc_now() |> DateTime.to_date()
```

When you run it, you can expect to see something like this:

```elixir
~D[2022-03-17]
```

This returns the current UTC date.

## Deep Dive 

Elixir's `DateTime` was introduced in version 1.3 as part of the standard library. Before that, developers used libraries like Timex. However, the introduction of `DateTime` as a built-in Elixir module made handling date and time simpler and more straightforward.

Despite `DateTime`'s functionality ease, you might want to use other ways to get the current time. For instance, `NaiveDateTime.local_now/0` gives local date and time without timezone info. 

Your choice depends on whether your application needs to account for time zones. But remember: it's usually best to use UTC date and handle timezone conversions separately.

Another aspect to consider is system clock skews, which might give imprecise results. However, this is a larger timekeeping issue not specific to Elixir programming.
