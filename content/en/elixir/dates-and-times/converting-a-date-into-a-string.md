## What & Why?

Converting a date to a string in Elixir turns the date from a struct into a readable series of characters for display or storage. Programmers do it to record timestamps, display dates in templates, or to serialize data for communication with external services.

## How to:

In Elixir, the `Date` module has a `to_string/1` function that converts a date to a string.

```elixir
date = ~D[2023-03-14]
date_string = Date.to_string(date)
IO.puts(date_string)  # "2023-03-14"
```

For more custom formatting, you can use `Timex`:
```elixir
{:ok, datetime} = DateTime.new(~D[2023-03-14], {0, 0, 0})
formatted_date = Timex.format!(datetime, "{YYYY}-{0M}-{0D}")
IO.puts(formatted_date)  # "2023-03-14"
```

## Deep Dive

Before Elixir 1.3, date and time manipulation was more cumbersome and reliant on third-party libraries. With version 1.3 and later, Elixir incorporated the `Date`, `Time`, and `DateTime` modules for better handling of dates and times.

When you need formatting beyond the ISO8601 standard, consider the `Timex` library, an Elixir package providing a complete date-time handling experience. 

Conversion to a string isn't magic. It's about representing the complex `Date` struct into something universally understandable. A struct holds more information than the string representation, so be aware that converting back from a string to a date will lose this extra context unless appropriately encoded.
