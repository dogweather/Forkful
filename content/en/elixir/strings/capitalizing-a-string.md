## What & Why?

Capitalizing a string involves converting the first letter of the string to uppercase while ensuring the rest of the letters are in lowercase. This action is commonly needed for formatting user input or displaying text in user interfaces, where consistency and readability are important.

## How to:

Elixir provides a straightforward way to capitalize strings using its built-in functions without the need for third-party libraries. Here's a simple example:

```elixir
string = "elixir programming"
capitalized_string = String.capitalize(string)
IO.puts capitalized_string
```

Output:

```
Elixir programming
```

For cases where more control or complex capitalization logic is needed, you might combine different String functions. For instance, if you want to capitalize every word in a sentence, you can split the sentence into words, capitalize each, and then join them back together:

```elixir
sentence = "elixir is fun"
capitalized_sentence = sentence 
                        |> String.split() 
                        |> Enum.map(&String.capitalize/1) 
                        |> Enum.join(" ")

IO.puts capitalized_sentence
```

Output:

```
Elixir Is Fun
```

While Elixirâ€™s standard library covers most needs, for more nuanced text manipulation, including advanced string capitalization, you might explore third-party libraries such as Cldr for internationalization, which can offer locale-specific capitalization behaviors.
