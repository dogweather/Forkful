## How to:
In Elixir, we often use pattern matching and the `case` statement to handle different outcomes, including errors.

```elixir
defmodule Example do
  def divide(a, b) do
    case b do
      0 -> {:error, "Cannot divide by zero."}
      _ -> {:ok, a / b}
    end
  end
end

# Successful division
{:ok, result} = Example.divide(10, 2)
IO.puts("10 / 2 is #{result}")

# Attempt to divide by zero
{:error, reason} = Example.divide(10, 0)
IO.puts("Error: #{reason}")
```

Sample output:
```
10 / 2 is 5.0
Error: Cannot divide by zero.
```

When you run this Elixir code, you'll either get a successful division or an error message, depending on your input. No crashes here!

## Deep Dive
Way back, error handling was often about checking return values. With Elixirâ€™s functional roots though, we've got pattern matching and tagged tuples, like `{:ok, value}` or `{:error, reason}`, which are more elegant.

There are other ways to handle errors in Elixir:

- **Elixir's `try` and `rescue`** which resemble the traditional `try-catch` in imperative languages but are used less frequently due to Elixir's preference for explicitness.
- **Supervisors and GenServers**, part of Elixir's OTP framework, which are more about fault tolerance. They watch your code's process, ready to restart it if things go awry.

Implementation-wise, Elixir builds on Erlang's robustness. It treats errors as just another type of message to be handled with all the pattern matching and functional goodness.
