## What & Why?

Sending an HTTP request in Google Apps Script is about programmatically making a call to an external web server or API. Programmers do this to retrieve or send data to web services, integrating a vast realm of web resources and functionalities directly into their Google Apps Script projects.

## How to:

In Google Apps Script, the primary way to send an HTTP request is by using the `UrlFetchApp` service. This service provides methods to make HTTP GET and POST requests. Here’s a simple example of making a GET request to retrieve JSON data:

```javascript
function fetchJsonData() {
  var url = 'https://api.example.com/data';
  var response = UrlFetchApp.fetch(url);
  var json = response.getContentText();
  var data = JSON.parse(json);
  
  Logger.log(data);
}
```

For a POST request, which is commonly used to send data to a server, you need to include more details in the options parameter:

```javascript
function postExample() {
  var url = 'https://api.example.com/post';
  var payload = {
    key1: 'value1',
    key2: 'value2'
  };
  
  var options = {
    'method' : 'post',
    'contentType': 'application/json',
    // Convert the JavaScript object to a JSON string
    'payload' : JSON.stringify(payload)
  };
  
  var response = UrlFetchApp.fetch(url, options);
  Logger.log(response.getContentText());
}
```

These snippets show basic GET and POST request implementations. The output will depend on the API response and can be viewed in Google Apps Script's Logger.

## Deep Dive

Google Apps Script’s `UrlFetchApp` service has evolved significantly since its inception, offering more nuanced control over HTTP requests with features like setting headers, payload, and handling multipart/form-data for file uploads. While it provides a straightforward means to integrate external web services, developers coming from more robust backend languages may find its functionality somewhat limiting compared to libraries like Python's `requests` or JavaScript's `fetch` API in Node.js.

One notable limitation is the execution time limit for Google Apps Script, which affects long-running requests. Additionally, while `UrlFetchApp` covers a wide range of use cases, more complex scenarios involving OAuth authentication or handling very large payloads may require creative solutions or leveraging additional Google Cloud resources.

Nonetheless, for most integrations that Google Workspace developers encounter—ranging from automating data retrieval to posting updates to external services—`UrlFetchApp` provides a potent, accessible tool. Its integration into Google Apps Script means there's no need for external libraries or complex setup, making HTTP requests relatively straightforward to execute within the constraints of Google Apps Script. As the landscape of web APIs continues to expand, `UrlFetchApp` remains a critical bridge for Google Apps Script programs to interact with the world beyond Google's ecosystem.
