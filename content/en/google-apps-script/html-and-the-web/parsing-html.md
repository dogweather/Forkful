## What & Why?
Parsing HTML in Google Apps Script involves extracting data from HTML content, which is particularly useful when interacting with web pages or web-based data sources. Programmers do this to automate data collection, manipulate web content, or integrate web functionalities with Google Apps like Sheets and Docs.

## How to:
Google Apps Script doesn't have a built-in method for parsing HTML. However, you can leverage the `UrlFetchApp` service for retrieving HTML content and then use JavaScript methods or regex (regular expressions) for parsing. Below is a basic example of how to fetch and parse the title tag from a webpage.

```javascript
function parseHTMLTitle(url) {
  // Fetch the HTML content of the webpage
  const response = UrlFetchApp.fetch(url);
  const htmlContent = response.getContentText();

  // Use a simple regex to find the content of the <title> tag
  const titleRegex = /<title>(.*?)<\/title>/;
  const match = htmlContent.match(titleRegex);

  // Check if a title was found and return it
  if (match && match.length > 1) {
    return match[1];
  }

  return 'No title found';
}

// Example usage
const url = 'http://example.com';
const pageTitle = parseHTMLTitle(url);
Logger.log(pageTitle); // Outputs the title of the webpage
```

For a more sophisticated HTML parsing, you can use the `XmlService` to parse the HTML as XML. Note, however, that this requires the HTML to be well-formed XML, which isn't always the case:

```javascript
function parseHTMLUsingXmlService(htmlContent) {
  try {
    const document = XmlService.parse(htmlContent);
    const rootElement = document.getRootElement();
    // From here, navigate the XML tree with XmlService methods
    // For example, to find a specific element or attribute
  } catch(e) {
    Logger.log('Error parsing HTML: ' + e.toString());
  }
}
```

## Deep Dive:
Historically, HTML parsing in environments like Google Apps Script has been challenging due to the lack of a Document Object Model (DOM) or dedicated parsing libraries that are common in other programming contexts. JavaScript in a browser, for instance, has the DOM readily available, and Node.js environments have access to a plethora of NPM packages like `cheerio` or `jsdom` for parsing HTML.

Google Apps Script's approach leans heavily on using `UrlFetchApp` for web requests and then manipulating the response data using either regex or XML parsing methods. While regex can be useful for simple parsing tasks, it is generally not advisable for complex HTML due to the risk of errors and the potentially brittle nature of the code. XML parsing with `XmlService` offers a more structured approach but requires well-formed HTML/XML, which can be a limitation when dealing with arbitrary web pages.

For complex parsing needs or when dealing with poorly-formed HTML, one alternative strategy might include using a web service external to Google Apps Script. This service could process HTML content, possibly using a more robust parsing technique or library, and then return the processed data in a form that's easily consumed by Google Apps Script. This approach, however, introduces network latency and the complexity of managing an additional web service. 

Despite these challenges, parsing HTML within Google Apps Script remains a powerful tool, especially when combined with other Google services and APIs, providing a range of automation possibilities that can significantly enhance productivity and data processing capabilities.
