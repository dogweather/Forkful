## What & Why?

Converting a string to lower case in Google Apps Script, a cloud-based scripting language for automating tasks across Google products, is a fundamental task aimed at standardizing text data. Programmers often perform this action to ensure consistency in user input, data processing, or when comparing strings, as it eliminates case sensitivity issues.

## How to:

Converting a string to lower case in Google Apps Script is straightforward, thanks to the built-in JavaScript methods available within the scripting environment. The `toLowerCase()` method is what you'll mostly use. Here’s how you can implement it:

```javascript
function convertToLower() {
  var originalString = "Hello, WORLD!";
  var lowerCaseString = originalString.toLowerCase();
  
  Logger.log(lowerCaseString); // Outputs: hello, world!
}
```

This simple function demonstrates taking an original string, applying the `toLowerCase()` method, and logging the result. This is particularly useful when dealing with inputs that need to be case-insensitive. For example, comparing email addresses that users might input in various cases.

Additionally, for situations where you're working with array data, you can map through each element to convert them into lower case:

```javascript
function convertArrayItemsToLower() {
  var namesArray = ["Alice", "BOB", "Charlie"];
  var lowerCaseNamesArray = namesArray.map(function(name) {
    return name.toLowerCase();
  });
  
  Logger.log(lowerCaseNamesArray); // Outputs: [alice, bob, charlie]
}
```

This example emphasizes the versatility of `toLowerCase()` when handling multiples of string data, ensuring uniformity across your dataset.

## Deep Dive

The `toLowerCase()` method, inherited from JavaScript and utilized within Google Apps Script, has been an integral part of string manipulation since the early versions of JavaScript. Its main purpose is to aid in the case-insensitive handling of textual data, a need that arose with the advent of dynamic, user-interactive web applications. Despite its simplicity, the mechanism plays a crucial role in data validation, sorting, and searching algorithms by reducing the complexity introduced by case sensitivity.

In terms of performance, the conversion process is highly optimized in modern JavaScript engines; however, its application should still be judicious within large-scale data operations to avoid unnecessary processing overhead.

An alternative to consider, especially when working with complex patterns or needing locale-specific conversions, is the `toLocaleLowerCase()` method. This variant considers locale-specific rules for converting characters to lower case, which might be essential for applications supporting multiple languages:

```javascript
var stringWithUmlaut = "MÄRZ";
var lowerCaseUmlaut = stringWithUmlaut.toLocaleLowerCase('de-DE');

Logger.log(lowerCaseUmlaut); // Outputs: märz
```

Despite the additional complexity, `toLocaleLowerCase()` is a powerful tool for international applications, ensuring that the conversion respects the linguistic norms of the user's locale. Whichever method you choose, converting strings to lower case remains a quintessential part of text processing in Google Apps Script, bridging the gap between user input and standardized data handling.
