## How to:
In Google Apps Script, string interpolation is achieved through template literals. These are string literals allowing embedded expressions, denoted by backticks (\`) instead of the usual quotes. Here's how you can use them:

```javascript
// A basic example
function basicInterpolationExample() {
  const user = 'Alice';
  console.log(`Hello, ${user}!`); // Output: Hello, Alice!
}

// Using expressions
function expressionInterpolationExample() {
  const a = 5;
  const b = 10;
  console.log(`Five plus ten is ${a + b}.`); // Output: Five plus ten is 15.
}

// Multi-line strings
function multiLineStringExample() {
  const item = 'Google Apps Script';
  console.log(`This is a multi-line string:
Hello all,
We are discussing ${item} today.`);
  // Output:
  // This is a multi-line string:
  // Hello all,
  // We are discussing Google Apps Script today.
}

basicInterpolationExample();
expressionInterpolationExample();
multiLineStringExample();
```

These examples illustrate basic usage, embedding expressions, and creating multi-line strings with interpolated values.

## Deep Dive
Template literals, including string interpolation, were introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) and subsequently adopted in Google Apps Script. Before this, programmers had to rely purely on string concatenation, which could get unwieldy for complex strings or when integrating many variable values.

```javascript
// Old way (prior to ES6)
var user = 'Bob';
console.log('Hello, ' + user + '!');
```

While string interpolation is a powerful feature, it's important to be mindful of the contexts in which it's used. For instance, directly embedding user input without proper sanitization can lead to security issues, such as injection attacks. Google Apps Script developers should ensure that any dynamic content interpolated into strings is properly checked or sanitized.

In comparison to other programming languages, the concept of string interpolation exists widely, with varying syntax. Python uses f-strings or the `format` method, Ruby uses `#{}` within double-quoted strings, and many modern languages have adopted similar features because of the readability and convenience they offer.

Although Google Apps Script does not offer additional interpolation features beyond those provided by ECMAScript standards, the functionality present is powerful and sufficient for most use cases. Developers coming from languages with more elaborate interpolation mechanisms may need to adjust their expectations but will likely appreciate the simplicity and efficiency of template literals in Google Apps Script.
