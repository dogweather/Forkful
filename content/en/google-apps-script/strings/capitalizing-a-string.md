## What & Why?

Capitalizing a string involves modifying the input so that the first character is uppercase while the rest remain lowercase, commonly used for formatting names or titles. Programmers do this to ensure data consistency and improve readability within user interfaces or documents.

## How to:

Google Apps Script, being based on JavaScript, allows several methods to capitalize a string, albeit without a built-in function. Here are a couple of succinct examples:

**Method 1: Using charAt() and slice()**

```javascript
function capitalizeString(inputString) {
  if (!inputString) return '';
  return inputString.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + inputString.slice(1).toLowerCase();
}

// Sample usage
let result = capitalizeString('hello, world');
console.log(result);  // Output: Hello, world
```

**Method 2: Using a Regex**

For those who prefer a regex-based solution to handle edge cases more elegantly:

```javascript
function capitalizeStringRegex(inputString) {
  return inputString.toLowerCase().replace(/^\w/, c => c.toUpperCase());
}

// Sample usage
let result = capitalizeStringRegex('hello, world');
console.log(result);  // Output: Hello, world
```

Both methods ensure the first character of the string is capitalized, and the rest are lowercase, suitable for a variety of applications including but not limited to Google Sheets manipulation or document editing via Apps Script.

## Deep Dive

Capitalizing strings in Google Apps Script is straightforward, leveraging JavaScript's powerful string manipulation capabilities. Historically, languages like Python offer built-in methods such as `.capitalize()` to achieve this, placing a slight extra step for JavaScript and Apps Script programmers. However, the absence of a built-in function in JavaScript/Google Apps Script encourages flexibility and a deeper understanding of string manipulation techniques. 

For complex scenarios, such as capitalizing each word in a string (Title Case), programmers might combine regex methods with `split()` and `map()` functions to process each word individually. Though Google Apps Script does not provide a direct method for string capitalization, the use of existing JavaScript string manipulation methods offers ample flexibility, allowing developers to handle strings efficiently according to their specific needs. 

In cases where performance and efficiency are paramount, it's worth noting that direct string manipulation might be more performant than regex, especially for longer strings or operations within large loops. However, for most practical applications within Google Apps Script, both approaches provide reliable solutions.
