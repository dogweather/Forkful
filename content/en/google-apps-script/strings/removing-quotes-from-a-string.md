summary: Removing quotes from a string in Google Apps Script is about eliminating
  unnecessary quotation marks that may surround your string data, usually stemming
  from parsed JSON objects, user input, or data extraction.

## How to:
Google Apps Script does not diverge far from standard JavaScript practices when it comes to handling strings and their manipulation. To remove quotes from a string, one can utilize the `replace()` method, which allows for replacing parts of the string using regular expressions. Here's a quick example:

```javascript
function removeQuotes() {
  var stringWithQuotes = '"This is a string surrounded by quotes"';
  // Use regular expression to replace quotes with nothing
  var stringWithoutQuotes = stringWithQuotes.replace(/^"|"$/g, '');
  Logger.log(stringWithoutQuotes); // Logs: This is a string surrounded by quotes
}
```

The `^"` targets a quote at the start of the string, and `"$` targets a quote at the end of the string. The `g` modifier ensures the expression is applied globally across the string. This method is quick, straightforward, and specifically targets only the outermost quotes of a string.

Hereâ€™s another scenario involving single quotes:

```javascript
function removeSingleQuotes() {
  var stringWithSingleQuotes = "'Here's a string with single quotes'";
  var stringWithoutSingleQuotes = stringWithSingleQuotes.replace(/^'|'$/g, '');
  Logger.log(stringWithoutSingleQuotes); // Logs: Here's a string with single quotes
}
```

These methods work well for simple, quotidian tasks of quote removal but might require refinement for more complex strings or different types of encapsulating characters.

## Deep Dive
The technique of removing quotes from strings using regular expressions has been around since the early days of programming, adapting as languages evolve. In Google Apps Script, leveraging JavaScript's robust string manipulation capabilities, including regular expressions, provides a powerful toolset for developers. However, it's essential to note the limitations and potential pitfalls: primarily, that this approach assumes quotes are only at the beginning and end of the string. Embedded quotes or quotes intended as part of the string's data could be inadvertently removed if not handled correctly.

For more complex scenarios, such as nested quotes or selectively removing quotes only when they encapsulate the string, a more nuanced approach or parser might be warranted. Libraries or built-in functions in other languages, like Python's `strip()` method, offer these functionalities out-of-the-box, showcasing a trade-off between the simplicity of Google Apps Script and the rich, specialized functionalities of other programming environments.

In practice, while the `replace()` method coupled with regular expressions offers a quick and accessible solution, developers must weigh the context of their data and the specificity of their needs. Alternative methods or additional checks might be necessary to robustly clean and process strings, ensuring the integrity and reliability of data manipulation in Google Apps Script. This highlights the importance of understanding the tools at your disposal and the nuances of the data you're working with, ensuring that functionality aligns closely with the peculiarities of your specific use case.
