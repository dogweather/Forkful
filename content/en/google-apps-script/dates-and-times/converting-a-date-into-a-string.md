## What & Why?

Converting dates into strings is a fundamental task that enables programmers to manipulate and display date information in a human-readable format. This is crucial for creating user interfaces, generating reports, or logging information in applications developed with Google Apps Script.

## How to:

Google Apps Script, being based on JavaScript, allows for multiple methods to achieve the conversion of dates to strings. Below are some examples illustrating different approaches:

### Using `toString()` Method:
The most straightforward method is to use the `toString()` method, which converts the date object to a string in the default format.

```javascript
var date = new Date();  // Creates a new date object
var dateString = date.toString();
Logger.log(dateString); // Output: "Wed Apr 05 2023 12:34:56 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)"
```

### Using `toDateString()` Method:
To get just the date part in a readable format without the time information, `toDateString()` can be used.

```javascript
var date = new Date();
var dateString = date.toDateString();
Logger.log(dateString); // Output: "Wed Apr 05 2023"
```

### Using `Utilities.formatDate()` for Custom Formats:
For more control over the format, Google Apps Script provides `Utilities.formatDate()`. This method requires three parameters: the date object, the time zone, and the format string.

```javascript
var date = new Date();
var timeZone = Session.getScriptTimeZone();
var formattedDate = Utilities.formatDate(date, timeZone, "YYYY-MM-dd");
Logger.log(formattedDate); // Output: "2023-04-05"
```

This method is particularly powerful for generating dates in formats that are locale-specific or suited to specific application requirements.

## Deep Dive

The necessity to convert dates into strings is not unique to Google Apps Script; it's prevalent across all programming languages. However, Google Apps Script's approach, inherited from JavaScript, offers a flexible set of options catered towards web-based scripting. `Utilities.formatDate()` stands out by acknowledging the complexities of working with time zones â€“ a challenge often overlooked. 

Historically, handling dates and times has been a source of bugs and complexity in software development, primarily due to differences in time zones and formats. The introduction of `Utilities.formatDate()` in Google Apps Script is a nod towards standardizing date-time manipulations, especially in the context of Google's suite of products which are used globally.

However, when precise control over time zones, locales, and formats is required, especially in internationalized applications, developers might find themselves leveraging external libraries such as `Moment.js` (despite its growing preference for `Luxon`, `Day.js`, and `date-fns` due to bundle size concerns and modern features). This approach, of course, comes with the trade-off of adding external dependencies and possibly increased project complexity. 

Despite the potential for external libraries, `Utilities.formatDate()` and the native JavaScript date methods offer robust solutions for most common use cases. Savvy developers will balance the simplicity and convenience of built-in functions with the power and flexibility of external libraries, depending on their project's specific needs.
