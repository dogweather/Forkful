## What & Why?

Starting a new project on Arduino means initializing a fresh sketch, the canvas for your code. Programmers do this to breathe life into new gadgets, from blinking LEDs to robotics.

## How to:

```Arduino
// Create a simple Blink sketch to start off a new Arduino project

void setup() {
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT); // Set the built-in LED as an output
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH); // Turn the LED on
  delay(1000);                     // Wait for a second
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);  // Turn the LED off
  delay(1000);                     // Wait for another second
}
```

Connect your Arduino board, upload the sketch, and watch the built-in LED blink every second.

## Deep Dive

When you embark on a new Arduino project, you're treading in the footsteps of countless inventors and tinkerers. Arduino started in 2005 in Ivrea, Italy, as a tool for students without a background in electronics and programming. Since then, it's become a staple in DIY electronics, prototyping, and educational coding.

There are alternatives to starting a project from scratch. You can modify existing code or use libraries to add complex features without reinventing the wheel – but nothing beats the excitement of creating something uniquely yours.

The sketch starts with the `setup()` function, which runs once to set up your hardware, followed by the `loop()` function, which runs continuously, letting you control your project's behavior. Master the use and structure of these functions, and you're well on your way to becoming an Arduino pro.
