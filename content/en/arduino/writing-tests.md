## What & Why?
Writing tests means creating a set of conditions to check if your code behaves as expected. Programmers do it to catch bugs early, ensure software quality, and save the headache when adding new features.

## How to:
```Arduino
#include <Arduino.h>
#include <unity.h>

void setUp(void) {
// set stuff up here
}

void tearDown(void) {
// clean up here
}

void test_led_builtin_pin_number(void) {
    TEST_ASSERT_EQUAL(13, LED_BUILTIN);
}

void test_led_state_high(void) {
    digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);
    TEST_ASSERT_EQUAL(digitalRead(LED_BUILTIN), HIGH);
}

void setup() {
    UNITY_BEGIN();
    RUN_TEST(test_led_builtin_pin_number);
    RUN_TEST(test_led_state_high);
    UNITY_END();
}

void loop() {
    // Usually empty in testing
}
```
Output:
```
.
.
OK
```

## Deep Dive
Historical context: Testing in Arduino came later than in software dev and was less common due to hardware interaction. Alternatives: Manual testing, or more complex test frameworks like Google Test. Implementation details: Typically we use a library like ArduinoUnit or AUnit. Place tests in `setup()` and keep `loop()` empty as tests run once.
