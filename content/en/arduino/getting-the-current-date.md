## What & Why?
Getting the current date in Arduino projects involves obtaining real-time information that can be crucial for logging, timestamping, or scheduling tasks. Programmers often need this capability to enhance functionality, ensure data relevance, and facilitate time-sensitive operations in their IoT and embedded projects.

## How to:
Arduino itself doesn't have a built-in method to directly fetch the current date, as it lacks a real-time clock (RTC). However, this can be achieved using external RTC modules like the DS3231, and libraries such as `RTClib`, developed by Adafruit, which makes interfacing with these modules straightforward.

First, ensure the `RTClib` library is installed in your Arduino IDE. Then, connect your RTC module to your Arduino according to its documentation.

Here's a simple example to get you started:

```cpp
#include <Wire.h>
#include "RTClib.h"

RTC_DS3231 rtc;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);

  if (!rtc.begin()) {
    Serial.println("Couldn't find RTC");
    while (1);
  }

  if (rtc.lostPower()) {
    Serial.println("RTC lost power, let's set the time!");
    // When time needs to be set on a new device or after a power loss, you can set it here.
    // rtc.adjust(DateTime(F(__DATE__), F(__TIME__)));
  }
}

void loop() {
  DateTime now = rtc.now();

  Serial.print("Current Date: ");
  Serial.print(now.year(), DEC);
  Serial.print('/');
  Serial.print(now.month(), DEC);
  Serial.print('/');
  Serial.println(now.day(), DEC);

  delay(3000); // Delay for 3 seconds to reduce serial spam
}
```

Sample output (assuming your RTC has been previously set):

```
Current Date: 2023/4/15
```

This code initializes the RTC module and then, in the loop, fetches and prints the current date to the Serial Monitor every 3 seconds. Remember, the `rtc.adjust(...)` line can be uncommented and modified to set the RTC's date and time initially or after it has lost power.
