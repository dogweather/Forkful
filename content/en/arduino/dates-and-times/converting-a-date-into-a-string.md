## How to:
Here's a straightforward example of converting a date to a string on Arduino:

```Arduino
#include <RTClib.h>

RTC_DS3231 rtc;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  if (!rtc.begin()) {
    Serial.println("Couldn't find RTC");
    while (1);
  }
  
  DateTime now = rtc.now();
  char dateString[11]; // Enough space for "DD/MM/YYYY"

  sprintf(dateString, "%02d/%02d/%04d", now.day(), now.month(), now.year());
  Serial.println(dateString);
}

void loop() {
  // No need to repeat the conversion.
}
```

Sample output:

```
23/03/2023
```

## Deep Dive
Historically, time representation has been a complex aspect of programming due to different formats and time zones. Arduino's time-related functions take care of the complexity, allowing us to focus on making sense of the time data.

While we used the `RTClib` library, alternatives like the `TimeLib.h` offer similar functionality. Choosing one depends on preference and specific features, like built-in time zone handling.

The key function `sprintf` used here formats the data into a string. It's based on the C standard library function, which is robust but can be memory-intensive for complex usage. A lighter, more basic alternative would be `snprintf`, which ensures you don't exceed your buffer size and is safer against buffer overflows.
