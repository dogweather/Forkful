## How to:
Let's say your Arduino's reading a sensor that may occasionally produce out-of-range values. Here's how you might handle that:

```Arduino
int sensorValue = analogRead(A0);

if (sensorValue >= 0 && sensorValue <= 1023) {
  // Value is within range, proceed with processing
  Serial.println(sensorValue);
} else {
  // Value is out of range, handle the error
  Serial.println("Error: Sensor value out of range.");
}
```
Sample Output:
```
523
Error: Sensor value out of range.
761
```

## Deep Dive
Error handling hasn't always been so straightforward. In the early days, developers often ignored errors, leading to the dreaded "undefined behavior." As programming evolved, so did the tools — you now have exceptions in many languages, but they’re still an old-school 'check-it-first' in the Arduino world due to hardware constraints and C++ roots.

In Arduino programming, you often see `if-else` statements for error handling. But there are alternatives: using the `assert` function to stop execution if a condition fails or designing fail-safes within your hardware setup itself.

When implementing error handling, consider the impact of stopping the program versus allowing it to continue with a default or safe state. There's a trade-off, and the right choice depends on the potential harm of interruptions versus incorrect operation.
