## What & Why?

Parsing HTML in Arduino projects is about extracting information from web pages. Programmers do this to enable their Arduino devices to interact with the Internet, collecting data from websites for purposes ranging from home automation to environmental monitoring.

## How to:

Parsing HTML on Arduino usually demands minimal footprint libraries due to limited device resources. A popular choice for web scraping and parsing is using the `ESP8266HTTPClient` and `ESP8266WiFi` libraries for ESP8266, or their ESP32 counterparts, given their native support for Wi-Fi capabilities and HTTP protocols. Here’s a basic example to fetch and parse HTML, assuming you’re working with an ESP8266 or ESP32:

First, include the necessary libraries:
```cpp
#include <ESP8266WiFi.h> // For ESP8266
#include <ESP8266HTTPClient.h>
#include <WiFiClient.h>
// Use analogous ESP32 libraries if using an ESP32

const char* ssid = "yourSSID";
const char* password = "yourPASSWORD";
```

Connect to your Wi-Fi network:
```cpp
void setup() {
    Serial.begin(115200);
    WiFi.begin(ssid, password);

    while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {
        delay(1000);
        Serial.println("Connecting...");
    }
}
```

Make an HTTP request and parse a simple piece of HTML:
```cpp
void loop() {
    if (WiFi.status() == WL_CONNECTED) { //Check WiFi connection status
        HTTPClient http;  //Declare an object of class HTTPClient

        http.begin("http://example.com");  //Specify request destination
        int httpCode = http.GET();  //Send the request

        if (httpCode > 0) { //Check the returning code
            String payload = http.getString();   //Get the request response payload
            Serial.println(payload);             //Print the response payload

            // Parse a specific part, e.g., extracting title from payload
            int titleStart = payload.indexOf("<title>") + 7; // +7 to move past the "<title>" tag
            int titleEnd = payload.indexOf("</title>", titleStart);
            String pageTitle = payload.substring(titleStart, titleEnd);

            Serial.print("Page Title: ");
            Serial.println(pageTitle);
        }

        http.end();   //Close connection
    }

    delay(10000); //Make a request every 10 seconds
}
```

Sample output (assuming http://example.com has a simple HTML structure):
```
Connecting...
...
Page Title: Example Domain
```

This example demonstrates fetching an HTML page and extracting the `<title>` tag content. For more complex HTML parsing, consider using regular expressions (with caution due to memory constraints) or string manipulation functions to navigate through the HTML structure. Advanced parsing might require more sophisticated approaches, including custom parsing algorithms tailored to the specific structure of HTML you're dealing with, as the standard Arduino environment does not include a built-in HTML parsing library.
