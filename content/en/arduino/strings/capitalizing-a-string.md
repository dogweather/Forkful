## What & Why?
Capitalizing a string involves converting the first character of each word in a string to uppercase while ensuring the rest remain lowercase. This operation is common in data formatting and user input normalization to maintain consistency and improve readability. 

## How to:
Arduino, primarily known for interacting with hardware, also includes basic string manipulation capabilities through its `String` object. However, it lacks a direct `capitalize` function seen in higher-level languages. Thus, we implement capitalization by iterating over a string and applying case transformations.

Here's a basic example without using third-party libraries:

```cpp
String capitalizeString(String input) {
  if (input.length() == 0) {
    return ""; // Return an empty string if input is empty
  }
  input.toLowerCase(); // Convert the entire string to lowercase first
  input.setCharAt(0, input.charAt(0) - 32); // Capitalize the first character
  
  // Capitalize letters that follow a space
  for (int i = 1; i < input.length(); i++) {
    if (input.charAt(i - 1) == ' ') {
      input.setCharAt(i, input.charAt(i) - 32);
    }
  }
  return input;
}

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  String testStr = "hello arduino world";
  String capitalizedStr = capitalizeString(testStr);
  Serial.println(capitalizedStr); // Output: "Hello Arduino World"
}

void loop() {
  // Empty loop
}
```

This code snippet defines a `capitalizeString` function that first converts the entire string to lowercase to standardize its case. It then capitalizes the first character and any character that follows a space, effectively capitalizing each word in the input string. Note that this rudimentary implementation assumes ASCII character encoding and may need adjustments for full Unicode support.

Currently, there aren't widely adopted third-party libraries specifically for string manipulation in the Arduino ecosystem, mainly due to its focus on hardware interaction and efficiency. However, the provided example is a straightforward way to achieve string capitalization within Arduino's programming environment.
