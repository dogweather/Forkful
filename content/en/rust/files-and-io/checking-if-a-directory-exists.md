## How to:
Rust's standard library (`std`) includes functionality to check for the existence of a directory through the `std::path::Path` and `std::fs` modules. Here's a simple example using Rust's standard approach:

```rust
use std::path::Path;

fn main() {
    let path = Path::new("/path/to/directory");
    if path.exists() && path.is_dir() {
        println!("The directory exists.");
    } else {
        println!("The directory does not exist.");
    }
}
```

Sample output, assuming the directory exists:
```
The directory exists.
```

For more complex scenarios or enhanced features (like asynchronous file system operations), you might consider using a third-party library such as `tokio` with its asynchronous `fs` module, especially if you're working within an async runtime. Here's how you could achieve the same with `tokio`:

First, add `tokio` to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
tokio = { version = "1.0", features = ["full"] }
```

Then, use `tokio::fs` to check if a directory exists asynchronously:

```rust
use tokio::fs;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let path = "/path/to/directory";
    match fs::metadata(path).await {
        Ok(metadata) => {
            if metadata.is_dir() {
                println!("The directory exists.");
            } else {
                println!("The path exists but is not a directory.");
            }
        },
        Err(_) => println!("The directory does not exist."),
    }
}
```

Sample output, assuming the directory does not exist:
```
The directory does not exist.
```

These examples highlight how Rust and its ecosystem offer both synchronous and asynchronous approaches to directory existence checks, catering to a wide range of software development needs.
