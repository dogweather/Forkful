## How to:
Here's the simplest way to grab arguments:

```Rust
use std::env;

fn main() {
    let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect();
    println!("{:?}", args);
}
```

Run it with `cargo run arg1 arg2`. You'll see:

```
["path/to/executable", "arg1", "arg2"]
```

A tidier option with iterators:

```Rust
use std::env;

fn main() {
    for arg in env::args().skip(1) {
        println!("{}", arg);
    }
}
```

Now try `cargo run cool stuff`:

```
cool
stuff
```

## Deep Dive
Historically, command line arguments are a throwback to the days when GUIs weren't widespread. Now, they're great for scripts, servers, or tools.

Rust's `std::env::args` uses an iterator, which is memory efficient and lazy. It handles Unicode too. There's also `args_os` for raw OS strings.

For complex parsing, crates like `clap` or `structopt` come in handy. They parse flags, options, and subcommands.
