## How to:
Rust's standard library makes it straightforward to read files.

```Rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::{self, Read};

fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
    let mut file = File::open("example.txt")?;
    let mut contents = String::new();
    file.read_to_string(&mut contents)?;
    println!("File Contents:\n{}", contents);
    Ok(())
}
```
This code opens "example.txt", reads it, and prints the contents.

Sample output:
```
File Contents:
Hello, Rustaceans!
```

## Deep Dive
Historically, file IO can be complex, but Rust simplifies it. There are alternatives to `read_to_string`, like using `BufRead` for line-by-line handling, which is more efficient on larger files. Under the hood, Rust's file reading leverages OS-level system calls, buffering data for efficiency.

Post-Rust 1.0, the language emphasizes safe system interactions â€“ reading a file is no exception. The `Result` type encapsulates potential errors, making Rust robust against common pitfalls like missing files or permission issues without resorting to panics.
