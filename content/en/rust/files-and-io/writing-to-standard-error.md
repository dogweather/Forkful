summary: Writing to standard error (stderr) in Rust is about directing error messages
  and diagnostics to the console separately from the standard output (stdout).

## How to:
Rust provides a straightforward way to write to stderr using the `eprintln!` macro, similar to how `println!` is used for stdout. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```rust
fn main() {
    eprintln!("This is an error message!");
}
```

Sample output (to standard error):
```
This is an error message!
```

For more control over the error messages, such as when you want to format text or handle I/O results, use the `stderr` function from the `std::io` module. This method provides a handle to the global stderr stream, which you can then write to using methods like `write_all` or `writeln` from the `Write` trait:

```rust
use std::io::{self, Write};

fn main() {
    let stderr = io::stderr();
    let mut handle = stderr.lock();
    
    writeln!(handle, "Formatted error message: {}", 404).expect("Failed to write to stderr");
}
```

Sample output (to standard error):
```
Formatted error message: 404
```

If you are working in environments or applications where you rely on libraries for logging or error handling, libraries such as `log` and `env_logger` are popular. Though they are used more for logging purposes, they are configurable and can direct error log levels to stderr. Below is a simple usage example using `log` and `env_logger`:

First, add the dependencies to your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
log = "0.4"
env_logger = "0.9"
```

Then, setup and use the logging in your application:
```rust
fn main() {
    env_logger::init();
    log::error!("This is an error message logged to stderr");
}
```

Running this program (after setting up `env_logger` with an appropriate environment variable, for example, `RUST_LOG=error`) will output the error message to stderr, utilizing the logging infrastructure.

```plaintext
ERROR: This is an error message logged to stderr
```
