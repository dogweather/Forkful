## What & Why?

String interpolation inserts variables right into strings. It makes building strings smooth and readable, avoiding clunky concatenations.

## How to:

In Rust, we use the `format!` macro:

```Rust
fn main() {
    let name = "Ferris";
    let greeting = format!("Hello, {}!", name);
    println!("{}", greeting); // Prints "Hello, Ferris!"
}
```
The `format!` macro works like `println!`, but it returns the formatted string instead of printing it.

## Deep Dive

Rust chose macros like `format!` for string interpolation over in-language syntax. Why? Macros are powerful and flexibleâ€”extending language functionality without complex syntax.

Historically, languages like C used functions like `sprintf`, clunky and error-prone. Rust's `format!` macro is safer, preventing common mistakes.

Alternatives exist, like concatenating with `+` or the `format_args!` macro for avoiding heap allocation. But when it comes to ease and clarity, `format!` is king.

Performance note: `format!` allocates memory. For performance-critical code, consider other methods, like writing directly to a buffer.
