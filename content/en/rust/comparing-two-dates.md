## What & Why?
Comparing two dates means checking if they're equal, or if one comes before or after the other. Programmers use this to sort events, validate input, handle expiration, and track durations.

## How to:
Rust uses `chrono` to handle dates easily. First, `cargo.toml` needs `chrono = "0.4"`. Then you can compare dates like this:

```Rust
extern crate chrono;
use chrono::{DateTime, Utc};

fn main() {
    let date1: DateTime<Utc> = Utc::now();
    let date2: DateTime<Utc> = Utc::now(); // Change this for different results

    if date1 > date2 {
        println!("Date1 is later than Date2");
    } else if date1 < date2 {
        println!("Date1 is earlier than Date2");
    } else {
        println!("Date1 is equal to Date2");
    }
}
```

Sample output where `date1` is later:

```
Date1 is later than Date2
```

## Deep Dive
Back in Rust's early days (2010s), date comparison was trickierâ€”no `chrono` crate. `chrono` came and simplified things with types like `DateTime`. Before `chrono`, we'd manually handle time, prone to errors.

Why `chrono`? It abstracts complexities like time zones and leap years, making date comparisons reliable. Without it, you'd juggle Unix timestamps, clunky and less readable.

Alternatives to `chrono` exist, like `time` crate, but `chrono` is widely used for its simplicity and features.
