## What & Why?
Temporary files store information that a program needs short-term, but doesn't need to keep permanently. They're great for managing large data on-the-fly or when you need to transmit files between different parts of your application.

## How to:
Creating a temporary file in Rust is a breeze. Here's a simple example:

```Rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::Write;
use tempfile::tempfile;

fn main() {
    let mut temp_file = tempfile().unwrap();
    write!(temp_file, "Hello, world!").unwrap();
}
```

In this Rust code, we import File and Write from std::io, and tempfile from the tempfile crate. We create our temporary file in the main function, then write to it using the write! macro.

## Deep Dive
Temporary files have a longstanding history in computing, dating back to the time of punch-cards. With limited computational resources, storing temporary results in files was a critical part of early algorithms.

There are alternatives to using temporary files. For smaller, transient data, keeping it in memory could be a better option, but only if you can afford the extra memory usage. 

In terms of implementation, the tempfile crate in Rust uses the OS's native approach to create temporary files securely and conveniently. On Unix systems, it uses libc::mkstemp. On Windows, it uses kernel32::CreateFileA with FILE_FLAG_DELETE_ON_CLOSE.
