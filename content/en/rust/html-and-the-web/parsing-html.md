## What & Why?

Parsing HTML in Rust is about extracting data from HTML documents, which is essential for web scraping, data extraction, or building web crawlers. Programmers do this to automate the collection of information from the web, analyze web content, or migrate content from one platform to another.

## How to:

To parse HTML in Rust, you'll often use the `scraper` crate, which provides a high-level interface to traverse and manipulate HTML documents.

First, add `scraper` to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
scraper = "0.12.0"
```

Next, here's a simple example that extracts all link URLs from a given HTML string:

```rust
extern crate scraper;

use scraper::{Html, Selector};

fn main() {
    let html = r#"
    <html>
    <body>
        <a href="http://example.com/1">Link 1</a>
        <a href="http://example.com/2">Link 2</a>
    </body>
    </html>
    "#;

    let document = Html::parse_document(html);
    let selector = Selector::parse("a").unwrap();

    for element in document.select(&selector) {
        let link = element.value().attr("href").unwrap();
        println!("Found link: {}", link);
    }
}
```

Output:

```
Found link: http://example.com/1
Found link: http://example.com/2
```

In this example, we parse a simple HTML document to find all `<a>` elements and extract their `href` attributes, effectively printing the URLs of all the links in the document. The `scraper` library simplifies HTML parsing and selecting specific elements using CSS selectors, making it a go-to for web scraping tasks in Rust.
