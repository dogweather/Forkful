## What & Why?
Printing debug output lets you spit out values to check if your program behaves as expected. It's your bread and butter for quick-and-dirty troubleshooting when things go awry.

## How to:
```gleam
import gleam/io

pub fn main() {
  let my_variable = "Debugging in Gleam is straightforward!";
  io.debug(my_variable)
}
```
Run it, and you'll see `Debugging in Gleam is straightforward!` in your terminal. It shows you what's up with your code at that moment.

## Deep Dive
Historically, printing debug output harks back to days when logging tools were luxury and rubber ducks werenâ€™t on desks. It's the first tool a dev thinks of even now, despite advanced debugging tools.

In Gleam, `io.debug` is the go-to. Alternatives include more structured logging libraries when you outgrow simple print statements. Under the hood, `io.debug` writes to standard error, making it distinguishable from standard output.
