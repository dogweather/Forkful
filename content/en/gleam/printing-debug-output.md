# Printing Debug Output in Gleam

## What & Why?

Debug output is a convenient way to inspect data within your Gleam program, serving like a window into your code's inner workings. Programmers use it to check data at a specific point in code, helping identify and debug issues.

## How To:

In Gleam, we use the built-in `debug` function to print debug output.

```Gleam
import gleam/io

fn main() {
  let mystery_number = 42
  io.debug(mystery_number)
}
```
Executing the above will output:
```Bash
42
```

## Deep Dive

Debugging, a practice as old as programming itself, is the process of identifying and fixing errors in the code. Built-in debug functions, like `io.debug` in Gleam, are a leap from primitive methods of manual code tracing. 

An alternative to `io.debug` in Gleam is `io.display` which, unlike `debug`, evaluates the string version of an expression and also neatly formats the display of complex datatypes.

```Gleam
import gleam/io

fn main() {
  let complex_data = tuple("Hello", 42, Nil)
  io.display(complex_data)
}
```
Gives you:
```Bash
#("Hello", 42, [])
```
The implementation of these functions in the Gleam core library revolves around evaluating code at runtime, converting values to strings, and printing the strings to stdout.
