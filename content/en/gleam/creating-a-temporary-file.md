# Creating a Temporary File in Gleam: Simple Steps and In-Depth Explorations 

## What & Why?

Creating a temporary file is a process of making a file that exists until it is deleted by the program or the operating system. Programmers use it as a safe storage space for data during the software's running period to handle big chunks of data or keep sensitive data off the disk.

## How to:

Use Gleam's `file` module to handle temporary files. Here's a quick run. Note that Gleam is statically typed, but infers types so you don't have to declare them.

```Gleam
import gleam/file.{TempFile}

fn temp_file_example() {
  let temp = TempFile.new("example_temp")
  let _ = file.write(temp, "Hello, Gleam!") 
}
```

You can check the creation of the file and its content with:

```Gleam
import gleam/file.{read}

fn read_temp_file() {
  let content = read("example_temp")
  io.println(content)
}
```

This will output: 

```Gleam
Ok("Hello, Gleam!")
```

## Deep Dive

Historically, temporary file management has been a crucial aspect of programming. In languages like C, programmers manually managed these files and took great care to secure, clean, and handle collision scenarios. 

Alternatives to temp files include in-memory-storage (like arrays or lists) or databases. You can choose based on the size, lifecycle, and security of the data.

As per implementation in Gleam, `file` module is designed to automate the process. Note the infered type signatures, the Erlang interoperability, and immutability concepts.
