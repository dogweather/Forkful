# Why Creating a Temporary File is Useful in Gleam Programming

Creating temporary files in Gleam can greatly improve the efficiency and reliability of your code. Temporary files are often used to store data during runtime, which can then be accessed and manipulated without altering the original files. This can be especially useful when working with large amounts of data or when testing new code.

# How To Create a Temporary File in Gleam

To create a temporary file in Gleam, we will use the `:file` module from the standard library. First, we will need to import the module:

```Gleam
import file
```

Next, we can use the `file.new_temporary` function to create a temporary file. This function takes in two parameters: the directory in which the temporary file should be created, and the prefix of the temporary file's name.

```Gleam
let temp_file = file.new_temporary(".", "data_")
```

This will create a temporary file named `data_xxxx` (where `xxxx` is a unique identifier) in the current directory. You can also specify a directory other than the current one, such as a temporary directory, to avoid cluttering your project directory with temporary files.

We can then write data to the temporary file using the `file.write` function:

```Gleam
file.write(temp_file, "This is some sample data.")
```

And finally, we can read the data from the temporary file using the `file.read` function:

```Gleam
let data = file.read(temp_file)
```

# Deep Dive into Creating Temporary Files in Gleam

Temporary files in Gleam are created using the `/tmp` directory by default. However, you can also specify a different temporary directory by setting the `GLEAM_TEMP` environment variable. This can be useful if you have limited storage space on your machine or want to keep temporary files separate from your main project directory.

Additionally, temporary files in Gleam are automatically deleted when the program exits, so you don't have to worry about manually deleting them. This helps keep your code clean and prevents any potential conflicts with future runs of your program.
