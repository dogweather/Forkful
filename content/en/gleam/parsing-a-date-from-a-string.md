## What & Why?

Parsing a date from a string is all about converting text into a date format that your program understands. Programmers do this to handle dates and times effectively, like sorting events or scheduling tasks.

## How to:

In Gleam, there isn't a built-in way to parse dates from strings as of my knowledge cutoff in early 2023. Usually, you'd use a library like `chrono` or `time` in other languages. You might need an external library or a custom function to do the job in Gleam. Here's a basic example with a hypothetical `parse_date` function.

```gleam
import gleam/calendar.{Date}

fn parse_date(date_string: String) -> Result(Date, String) {
  // This is where you'd implement your date parsing logic.
  // For now, let's pretend it magically works.
  Ok(Date(year: 2021, month: 3, day: 14))
}

pub fn main() {
  let date_string = "2021-03-14"
  case parse_date(date_string) {
    Ok(date) -> 
      date
    Error(error) ->
      error
  }
}
// Sample Output: Date(year: 2021, month: 3, day: 14)
```

## Deep Dive

The ability to parse dates comes from a need to interact with dates in a standardized way. Early programmers used various formats, leading to confusion. Standards like ISO 8601, which represents dates in the YYYY-MM-DD format, helped unify date representation across systems.

Without native support in Gleam for parsing dates, youâ€™re left with two choices: reach for an external library or roll your own solution. When writing your own parser, consider edge cases and adhere to a standard format for consistency.

Performance-wise, parsing can be expensive. To boost it, you could preprocess common date patterns. In distributed systems, ensure parsed dates adhere to the expected time zones and locales, as interpretations of dates can vary.
