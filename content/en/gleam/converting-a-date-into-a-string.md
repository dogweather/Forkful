## What & Why?

Converting a date to a string means turning a date object, which represents a specific moment in time, into a human-readable text format. Programmers do this to display dates in a user-friendly way or to serialize them for storage and communication.

## How to:

In Gleam, there's no built-in date type, but let's assume we're using a custom `Date` type and we want to convert it to a string. First, define your date type and conversion function:

```gleam
type Date {
  Date(year: Int, month: Int, day: Int)
}

fn date_to_string(date: Date) -> String {
  let Date(year, month, day) = date
  int_to_string(year) ++ "-" ++ int_to_string(month) ++ "-" ++ int_to_string(day)
}

pub fn main() {
  let my_date = Date(2023, 4, 3)
  let date_string = date_to_string(my_date)
  io.println(date_string) // "2023-4-3"
}
```

## Deep Dive

Historically, date formatting and parsing have been complex due to various date and time representations across different locales and standards. Most programming environments offer libraries that handle these complexities. In Gleam, which aims for strong type safety and concurrency, you often deal with external libraries, like `chronotope`, for date-time operations. 

An alternative to manual string conversion is using a standardized format like ISO 8601 (`YYYY-MM-DD`), which can be implemented using functions that pad single-digit months and days with zeros. 

Implementation-wise, date to string conversion may involve more than concatenating integers; locale-specific preferences might dictate using slashes or periods instead of dashes, and there's also the concern of time zones and whether to include time information alongside the date.
