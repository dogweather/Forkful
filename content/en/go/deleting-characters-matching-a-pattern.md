## Why

When working with large strings or datasets, it is often necessary to remove or filter out certain characters that match a specific pattern. For example, if you are working with a CSV file and want to remove all commas from a particular column, or if you are cleaning up text data and need to remove all punctuation marks. In these cases, knowing how to delete characters matching a pattern in Go can save you time and make your code more efficient.

## How To

To delete characters matching a pattern in Go, we can use the "regexp" package. This package allows us to define and manipulate regular expressions, which are patterns used to match or find certain patterns in strings.

To begin, we need to import the "regexp" package in our code. We can do this by using the following line of code:

```Go
import "regexp"
```

Next, we can define our regular expression using the "regexp.Compile()" function. For example, if we want to remove all punctuation marks from a string, we can use the following code:

```Go
re := regexp.Compile("[^a-zA-Z0-9]+")
```

The regular expression above matches any character that is not a letter or a number. We can then use the "re.ReplaceAllString()" function to replace all characters that match our pattern with an empty string. This effectively removes them from the original string.

```Go
str := "This is a sample string, with some punctuation marks!"
newStr := re.ReplaceAllString(str, "")
fmt.Println(newStr)

// Output:
// Thisisasamplestringwithsomepunctuationmarks
```

In the code above, we first define our regular expression and then use it to replace all punctuation marks in the original string with an empty string. Finally, we print out the new string without any punctuation marks.

## Deep Dive

Regular expressions in Go can be quite powerful and offer a wide range of options for matching patterns. They use a syntax that may seem daunting at first, but with some practice and understanding of the most commonly used expressions, you can easily manipulate strings to fit your needs.

Some other useful functions for deleting characters based on patterns in Go include:

- "regexp.Match()" - this function returns a boolean value indicating whether a string matches a regular expression or not.
- "regexp.FindString()" - this function returns the first substring that matches the regular expression.
- "regexp.Split()" - this function splits a string into an array of strings based on the regular expression provided.

There are also various symbols and metacharacters that you can use in your regular expressions to specify patterns. For example, the dot (.) symbol matches any single character, while the asterisk (*) symbol matches zero or more instances of the preceding element.

To learn more about regular expressions in Go, you can refer to the official documentation or explore some online resources. Regular expressions may seem intimidating at first, but once you understand the basics, you'll find them to be a powerful tool for manipulating strings in your code.
