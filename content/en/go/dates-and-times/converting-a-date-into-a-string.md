## How to:
In Go, the `time` package provides functionalities to work with dates and times, including formatting a `time.Time` object into a string. The `Format` method of the `time.Time` type is used for this purpose, where you specify the layout string according to reference time "Mon Jan 2 15:04:05 MST 2006".

### Example:
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	currentTime := time.Now() // gets the current date and time
	fmt.Println("Current Time:", currentTime)

	// Format the current time in dd-mm-yyyy format
	formattedDate := currentTime.Format("02-01-2006")
	fmt.Println("Formatted Date:", formattedDate)

	// Format the current time in more detail
	detailedFormat := currentTime.Format("Mon, 02 Jan 2006 15:04:05 MST")
	fmt.Println("Detailed Formatted Date:", detailedFormat)
}
```

#### Sample Output:
```
Current Time: 2023-04-12 11:45:20.312457 +0000 UTC
Formatted Date: 12-04-2023
Detailed Formatted Date: Wed, 12 Apr 2023 11:45:20 UTC
```

Output will vary based on the current date and time when the program is run.

## Deep Dive:
In the context of Go, date and time manipulation, including formatting, is handled predominantly by the `time` package. The approach to date formatting in Go, specified by the `Format` method using a specific layout string, is unique compared to many other programming languages that might use simple format specifiers like `%Y` for a 4-digit year. The Go way requires developers to remember the specific reference time: Mon Jan 2 15:04:05 MST 2006, as it acts as a pattern for formatting or parsing dates.

This method, though initially non-intuitive to developers familiar with strftime-like formatting functions, was designed for clarity and to avoid the confusion of locale-dependent formats. Once accustomed to it, many find this approach reduces errors and improves code readability.

Moreover, Go's standard library approach means that for most common use cases, third-party libraries are unnecessary. This simplifies dependency management and ensures consistent behavior across different projects. However, when working with more complex time zone conversions or recurring date calculations, developers might need to look into additional packages like `github.com/rickar/cal` for holiday calculations or `github.com/golang/time` for more nuanced time manipulation beyond what the standard `time` package offers.
