## What & Why?

Getting the current date in Go is a fundamental task for programmers, akin to "Hello, World!" in its ubiquity. It's essential for tasks ranging from logging and time-stamping events to calculating durations and scheduling future events.

## How to:

In Go, the `time` package is your gateway to working with dates and times. The `time.Now()` function gives you the current date and time, while other functions and methods allow you to format or manipulate this data. Here's how to get the current date and its various representations:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	currentTime := time.Now() // Gets the current date and time
	fmt.Println("Current time:", currentTime)

	// To get the date in a YYYY-MM-DD format
	fmt.Println("Current date:", currentTime.Format("2006-01-02"))

	// To get the individual components of the date
	year, month, day := currentTime.Date()
	fmt.Printf("Year: %d, Month: %s, Day: %d\n", year, month, day)

	// To get the weekday
	fmt.Println("Weekday:", currentTime.Weekday())
}
```

Sample output might look like this:

```
Current time: 2023-04-18 15:04:05.123456 +0000 UTC
Current date: 2023-04-18
Year: 2023, Month: April, Day: 18
Weekday: Tuesday
```

Notice how `Format` uses a specific date (2006-01-02) as the layout string. This is Go's chosen reference date, serving as a mnemonic pattern for formatting dates.

## Deep Dive

The decision to use the `time` package for date and time manipulation in Go reflects the language's dedication to robust and intuitive standard libraries. Unlike some languages that may have multiple competing libraries or methodologies for date manipulation, Go prioritizes having a single, well-documented standard.

The peculiar choice of the reference date (`Mon Jan 2 15:04:05 MST 2006`) in Go's time formatting, while initially confusing, is actually a masterstroke in usability. It allows programmers to represent date and time formats using an example-based approach, as opposed to memorizing tokens or symbols that other languages might use.

That said, while the `time` package offers comprehensive functionality for most needs, dealing with time zones and DST (Daylight Saving Time) changes can sometimes trip up new Go programmers. It's crucial to understand how Go handles location-specific time to avoid common pitfalls in time manipulation.

For more complex scheduling or time manipulation needs, third-party libraries such as `github.com/robfig/cron` for Go might offer more specialized functionality than the standard `time` package. However, for most applications that require getting and handling the current date and time, the `time` package offers a solid and idiomatic starting point in Go.
