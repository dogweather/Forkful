## How to:
In Go, string interpolation is commonly achieved using the `fmt` package, particularly with the `Sprintf` function, which lets you inject variables into a string by specifying formatting verbs. The verbs are placeholders in the format string and are replaced by the given variables' values. Here's how you use it:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    name := "Jane"
    age := 28

    // Using Sprintf for string interpolation
    message := fmt.Sprintf("Hello, my name is %s and I am %d years old.", name, age)
    fmt.Println(message) // Output: Hello, my name is Jane and I am 28 years old.
}
```

Note that `%s` is used for strings, and `%d` for integers. The `fmt` package documentation provides a comprehensive list of formatting verbs for different data types.

## Deep Dive
The concept of string interpolation exists in many programming languages, albeit with different syntaxes and capabilities. In Go, while the `fmt` package's `Sprintf` function is the most commonly used approach, it might not always be the most efficient, especially for simple concatenations or when working within highly performance-sensitive code. 

The `fmt` package uses reflection to dynamically interpret the types of the variables at runtime, which, while flexible, incurs overhead. For scenarios where performance is critical, direct string concatenation or the `strings.Builder` type may offer better alternatives. Direct concatenation is straightforward but can become unwieldy with multiple variables. `strings.Builder`, on the other hand, provides a more performant and readable way to build complex strings in a loop or when dealing with many variables:

```go
var sb strings.Builder
sb.WriteString("Hello, my name is ")
sb.WriteString(name)
sb.WriteString(" and I am ")
sb.WriteString(strconv.Itoa(age))
sb.WriteString(" years old.")
message := sb.String()

fmt.Println(message) // Outputs the same as before
```

Ultimately, the choice between `fmt.Sprintf`, direct concatenation, and `strings.Builder` depends on the specific requirements of your application, such as the complexity of the string being constructed and performance considerations.
