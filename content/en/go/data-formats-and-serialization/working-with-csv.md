## What & Why?

Comma-Separated Values (CSV) format is ubiquitous for data exchange due to its simplicity and ease of integration with most programming languages, including Go. Programmers often work with CSV files for data migration, report generation, or data analysis, making understanding CSV manipulation critical in a software development toolkit.

## How to:

Working with CSV files in Go is straightforward, thanks to its standard library, `encoding/csv`. Below is a primer on reading and writing CSV files.

### Reading a CSV File

To read from a CSV file, you first open the file using `os.Open`, then create a new CSV reader with `csv.NewReader`.

```go
package main

import (
    "encoding/csv"
    "fmt"
    "os"
)

func main() {
    file, err := os.Open("data.csv")
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    defer file.Close()

    reader := csv.NewReader(file)
    records, err := reader.ReadAll()
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    for _, record := range records {
        fmt.Println(record)
    }
}
```

This code snippet will read all records from `data.csv` and print them. Each record is a slice of fields.

### Writing to a CSV File

For writing, you use `csv.NewWriter` and `writer.WriteAll` or `writer.Write` for writing multiple or single CSV records, respectively.

```go
package main

import (
    "encoding/csv"
    "os"
)

func main() {
    file, err := os.Create("output.csv")
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    defer file.Close()

    writer := csv.NewWriter(file)
    defer writer.Flush()

    records := [][]string{
        {"Name", "Age", "City"},
        {"John Doe", "30", "New York"},
        {"Jane Doe", "27", "Los Angeles"},
    }

    if err := writer.WriteAll(records); err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
}
```

This will create a file named `output.csv` with the provided records. Always remember to flush the writer to ensure all buffered data is written to the file.

## Deep Dive

The Go `encoding/csv` package provides robust support for reading and writing CSV files but it's designed with simplicity in mind, which means it doesn't handle more complex scenarios such as auto-detection of delimiters, dealing with quotes or embedded line breaks in fields without manual handling.

Historically, CSV handling in programming languages has often been cumbersome due to these complexities, but Go's standard library abstracts many of these issues, allowing developers to work with CSV data with relative ease. However, for more complex CSV manipulation, third-party libraries like `gocsv` or handling the parsing manually may be necessary.

One notable aspect of Go's `csv` package is its support for specifying custom comma (delimiter), which allows it to work seamlessly with variants of CSV files, like tab-separated values (TSV). However, when dealing with highly irregular or non-standard CSV files, Go programmers might find themselves needing to extend the existing csv reader or writer implementations.

While Go's CSV handling capabilities are robust for general purposes, for applications requiring intensive data manipulation, such as data science or complex data transformation tasks, programmers might look into dedicated data processing packages or even other languages better suited to these tasks, like Python with its `pandas` library. Nonetheless, for straightforward CSV read-write operations, Go's standard library stands out for its efficiency and simplicity.
