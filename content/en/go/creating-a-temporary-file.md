## What & Why?

Creating a temporary file provides a safely isolated workspace for a software operation. Programmers perform this task when data needs to be processed transiently without the need for long-term storage or the risk of disrupting the original data.

## How to:

Here's a concise example:

```Go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"io/ioutil"
	"log"
)

func main() {
	tempFile, err := ioutil.TempFile("", "sample")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	fmt.Println("Temporary File Created => ", tempFile.Name())
}
```
The output: 

```Go
Temporary File Created => /tmp/sample183921029
```

Note: The output can vary based on the unique file name generated by TempFile function.

## Deep Dive

Historically, in Unixes, temporary files were created in '/tmp' and auto-deleted on system restart. In Go, `ioutil.TempFile` is used to create a file in an OS-specified temporary directory, ensuring cross-platform compatibility.

Alternatives to using `ioutil.TempFile` include creating a custom function for file generation or using external libraries like `os`, to create a non-temporary file followed by deleting manually.

The `ioutil.TempFile` function uses the Monotonic Elapsed time source, which ensures the uniqueness of the generated temporary file name. This effectively mitigates the risk of file name collisions.
