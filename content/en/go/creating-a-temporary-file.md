## Why 

Creating temporary files is a common programming task that may be necessary for a variety of reasons. Temporary files can be used to temporarily store data, act as buffers, or provide a location for logs or other temporary information. They are particularly useful for programs that need to store large amounts of data or for processes that require a temporary location to perform operations.

## How To

Creating a temporary file in Go is a fairly simple process. The first step is to import the "io/ioutil" package, which provides functions for temporary file creation. Next, we use the "ioutil.TempFile()" function to create a temporary file and assign it to a variable. We can then use this variable to write data to the file or perform any other necessary operations. Here's an example of how to create a temporary file in Go:

```Go
import "io/ioutil"

tempFile, err := ioutil.TempFile("", "example")
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println(err)
    return
}
defer tempFile.Close()

// Write data to the temporary file
_, err := tempFile.WriteString("This is a temporary file!")
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println(err)
    return
}

// Print the name of the temporary file
fmt.Println("Temporary file created:", tempFile.Name())
```

In this example, we first import the "io/ioutil" package and then use the "ioutil.TempFile()" function to create a temporary file. The first argument specifies the location in which to create the file, and an empty string indicates that the default temporary directory should be used. The second argument is a prefix that will be added to the temporary file name. Once the temporary file is created, we can use the variable "tempFile" to write data to the file, and then close it using the "defer" keyword to ensure it is closed even if an error occurs.

If we run this code, the following output will be printed:

```
Temporary file created: /tmp/example349362250
```

As you can see, the temporary file has a random name assigned to it by the operating system. This is done to ensure the file is unique and does not conflict with other temporary files.

## Deep Dive

When creating a temporary file, there are a few additional things to keep in mind. First, it is important to close the file once you are finished using it. This ensures that any buffered data is written to the file before it is deleted. As seen in the example above, the "defer" keyword can be used to automatically close the file at the end of the function.

Additionally, it is important to note that by default, temporary files are created with read and write permissions for the owner only. This means that if you need to share the temporary file with other processes or users, you will need to change the file permissions using the "os.Chmod()" function.
