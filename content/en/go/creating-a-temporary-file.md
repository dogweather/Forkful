## What & Why?

Creating a temporary file in programming means making a file that's meant for short-term use, usually as a scratch space or buffer. Programmers do this for tasks like storing data that doesn't need to persist, managing uploads before processing, or breaking down large tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks.

## How to:

Here's a quick and dirty way to create a temp file in Go:

```Go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "io/ioutil"
    "os"
)

func main() {
    // Create a temporary file
    tmpFile, err := ioutil.TempFile("", "example")
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    fmt.Println("Created File:", tmpFile.Name())
    
    // Cleanup: delete the file after you're done
    defer os.Remove(tmpFile.Name())

    // Write something to the file
    content := []byte("temporary file's content")
    if _, err = tmpFile.Write(content); err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    
    // Remember to close the file!
    if err := tmpFile.Close(); err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
}
```

When you run this code, it outputs the temp file's name. Something like: `Created File: /tmp/example123456`. Each time it's run, the `example123456` part changes, ensuring uniqueness.

## Deep Dive

Historically, temporary files are key to managing intermediate steps in data processing. They offer a safe space for trial and error without the risk of corrupting original data sets. 

Fast fact: Unix systems traditionally use `/tmp` for temporary storage, and Windows uses `%TEMP%`. Go abstracts this away - `ioutil.TempFile` uses the default temp folder your OS designates.

If you're wondering: yes, there are alternatives to `ioutil.TempFile`. You could create and manage a temp file manually, which gives more control but also comes with the risk of more bugs.

As for the implementation, `ioutil.TempFile` creates unique file names with a random string, greatly reducing the chance of naming collisions, which can be a real headache if you're processing lots of data at once.

Remember to use `defer` to clean up after yourself. Temp files are meant to be temporary, after all, and you don’t want to leave a mess for your system to deal with later.
