## What & Why?
Comparing two dates means checking how they relate: is one earlier, later, or the same as the other? Programmers do this to handle deadlines, schedule events, or track durations.

## How to:

```Go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	// Define two dates
	date1 := time.Date(2023, time.April, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, time.UTC)
	date2 := time.Now()

	// Compare dates
	if date1.Before(date2) {
		fmt.Println("Date1 is before Date2")
	} else if date1.After(date2) {
		fmt.Println("Date1 is after Date2")
	} else {
		fmt.Println("Date1 is the same as Date2")
	}
	
	// Get the duration between dates
	duration := date2.Sub(date1)
	fmt.Printf("Duration between dates: %v\n", duration)
}
```

Sample output for a run on April 2, 2023:

```
Date1 is before Date2
Duration between dates: 24h0m0s
```

## Deep Dive
In the old days, date comparison in programming was a headache â€” think convoluted calculations and constant bug fixing. Go makes it simpler with its `time` package. The `Before()`, `After()`, and `Equal()` methods easily compare `Time` objects.

You have alternatives. You could manually compare year, month, and day, but that's more code for the same outcome. Or you could use third-party libraries, though Go's standard library typically suffices.

Technically, `Sub()` gives a `Duration` type which you can convert into seconds, minutes, hours, or even nanoseconds. Remember, time zones can trip you up; always consider them when comparing dates.
