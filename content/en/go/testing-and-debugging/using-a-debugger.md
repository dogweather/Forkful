## What & Why?

Using a debugger in Go programming involves employing tools or features to inspect and modify the state of a running program to understand its behavior or diagnose issues. Programmers do this to efficiently find and fix bugs, optimize performance, and ensure the correctness of their code.

## How to:

Go provides a built-in facility for debugging called `delve`. It is a full-featured debugging tool that allows you to execute Go programs step by step, inspect program variables, and evaluate expressions.

To begin, you must first install `delve`. You can do this by running:

```shell
go get -u github.com/go-delve/delve/cmd/dlv
```

Now, let's debug a simple Go program. Consider a program `main.go`:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    message := "Debugging in Go"
    fmt.Println(message)
}
```

To start debugging this program, open a terminal in the project's directory and execute:

```shell
dlv debug
```

This command compiles the program with optimizations disabled (to improve the debugging experience), starts it, and attaches a debugger to it.

Once `delve` is running, you're in the interactive debugger shell. Here are a few basic commands:

- `break main.main` sets a breakpoint at the `main` function.
- `continue` resumes program execution until a breakpoint is hit.
- `print message` will print the value of the `message` variable.
- `next` advances the program execution to the next line.
- `quit` exits the debugger.

The output when hitting the breakpoint and printing the variable might look like this:

```shell
Breakpoint 1 at 0x49ecf3 for main.main() ./main.go:6
> main.main() ./main.go:6 (hits goroutine(1):1 total:1) (PC: 0x49ecf3)
     1: package main
     2:
     3: import "fmt"
     4:
     5: func main() {
     6: =>    message := "Debugging in Go"
     7:       fmt.Println(message)
     8: }
(dlv) print message
"Debugging in Go"
```

Using these commands, you can step through your program, inspecting the state as you go to understand how it behaves, and identify any issues.

## Deep Dive

The choice of `delve` as Go's debugging tool of choice over traditional tools like GDB (GNU Debugger) is primarily due to the nature of Go's execution model and runtime. GDB was not initially designed with the Go runtime in mind, making `delve` a more suitable choice for Go developers. `Delve` is specifically designed for Go, offering a more intuitive debugging experience for Go routines, channels, and other Go-specific constructs.

Furthermore, `delve` supports a wide array of features beyond those offered by basic GDB when working with Go programs. These include but are not limited to: attaching to running processes for debugging; conditional breakpoints; and evaluating complex expressions that may involve Go's concurrency primitives. 

While `delve` is the go-to debugger for many Go developers, it is worth noting that the Go toolchain also includes lighter-weight forms of debugging support, such as the built-in `pprof` tool for profiling and the `trace` tool for concurrency visualization. These tools can sometimes provide a faster or more high-level avenue for diagnosing program performance issues or concurrency bugs, which might be complementary or even preferable depending on the debugging context.
