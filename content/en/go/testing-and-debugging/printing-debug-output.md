## What & Why?

In computer programming, "Printing debug output" involves producing detailed informational messages that help developers understand the execution flow of their program or pinpoint issues. Programmers do this to diagnose and solve problems more efficiently, making it an essential skill in any programming toolkit, including Go.

## How to:

In Go, you can use the standard `fmt` package to print debug output to the console. The `fmt` package offers a variety of functions, like `Println`, `Printf`, and `Print`, catering to different formatting needs.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	// Simple message
	fmt.Println("Debug: Entering main function")

	var name = "Gopher"
	// Formatted message
	fmt.Printf("Hello, %s! This is a debug message.\n", name)

	// Using fmt.Print
	debugMsg := "This is another debug message."
	fmt.Print("Debug: ", debugMsg, "\n")
}
```

Sample output:
```
Debug: Entering main function
Hello, Gopher! This is a debug message.
Debug: This is another debug message.
```

For more sophisticated debugging, Go's `log` package can be employed to include timestamps and to output to different destinations, not just the console.

```go
package main

import (
	"log"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	// Creating a log file
	file, err := os.OpenFile("debug.log", os.O_CREATE|os.O_WRONLY|os.O_APPEND, 0666)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal("Error creating log file:", err)
	}
	defer file.Close()

	// Setting output of logs to file
	log.SetOutput(file)

	log.Println("This is a debug message with a timestamp.")
}
```

The message in `debug.log` would look something like this:
```
2023/04/01 15:00:00 This is a debug message with a timestamp.
```

## Deep Dive

Printing debug output has been a longstanding practice in computer programming, with its implementation varying across different languages. In Go, the standard library's `fmt` and `log` packages provide straightforward and versatile options. While the `fmt` package is sufficient for basic debugging needs, the `log` package offers enhanced functionality like logging levels and configurable output destinations.

Moreover, as applications become more complex, logging frameworks such as `zap` and `logrus` can offer more advanced features like structured logging and better performance. These third-party packages give developers the flexibility to tailor their logging strategy to their specific needs.

However, it's essential to strike the right balance in logging. Excessive debug output can clutter logs and make it harder to find useful information. Developers should consider using different log levels (e.g., debug, info, warn, error) to categorize the importance of messages, making logs easier to navigate and more meaningful.
