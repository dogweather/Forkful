## What & Why?
A REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) lets you interact with code live; it reads input, evaluates it, prints the result, and loops back. Programmers use it to test snippets, debug, and learn new languages in real-time.

## How to:
Go doesn't include a built-in REPL, but you can use third-party tools. One popular tool is `gore`:

```go
// Install gore using
$ go install github.com/motemen/gore/cmd/gore@latest

// Run gore
$ gore
gore version 0.5.0  :help for help
gore> :import fmt
gore> fmt.Println("Hello, Go REPL!")
Hello, Go REPL!
nil
```

## Deep Dive
Originally developed for Lisp, REPLs are common in dynamic languages like Python or Ruby. Go, being statically typed, doesn't include one out-of-the-box. Alternatives to `gore` include `go-pry` and `yaegi`. These tools interpret Go code, letting you explore and validate ideas quickly without compiling a full-blown app. They're especially useful for beginners and in educational contexts where the focus is on learning and experimentation.
