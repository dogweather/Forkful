## What & Why?
Extracting substrings means snipping out pieces of a string. Programmers do it to isolate, analyze, or manipulate specific bits of data within a larger string.

## How to:
Go makes it a breeze with the standard library and slicing. Here's the low-down:

```Go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"strings"
)

func main() {
	phrase := "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
	
	// Using slicing
	part := phrase[4:9]
	fmt.Println(part) // Output: quick
	
	// Using strings package
	start := strings.Index(phrase, "brown")
	end := start + len("brown")
	substring := phrase[start:end]
	fmt.Println(substring) // Output: brown
}
```

## Deep Dive
A quick history lesson: Go hit the scene in 2009 as an open-source project to make programming more fun and productive. It kept string manipulation straightforwardâ€”no regular expressions needed for simple tasks. Other languages like Python have similar slicing mechanisms.

Sure, there are alternatives like `regexp` and `bytes` package for heavy lifting. However, the basic `Index` function and slicing cover most needs without complication. Under the hood, strings in Go are just slices of bytes. So when you slice a string, you're actually creating a new slice header pointing to the original string's underlying array. This makes substring extraction in Go fast and memory-efficient.
