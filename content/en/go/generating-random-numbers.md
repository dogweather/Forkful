## What & Why?

Generating random numbers in Go involves using the `math/rand` package to produce pseudo-random numbers for various applications such as simulating experiments, generating test data, or adding unpredictability to games. Programmers utilize this feature to create dynamic and less predictable software behaviors.

## How to:

To start generating random numbers in Go, you need to import the `math/rand` package and the `time` package to seed the random number generator for more unpredictability. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```Go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math/rand"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	// Seed the generator
	rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())
	
	// Generate a random integer between 0 and 99
	randomInt := rand.Intn(100)
	fmt.Println("Random Integer:", randomInt)
	
	// Generate a random float between 0.0 and 1.0
	randomFloat := rand.Float64()
	fmt.Println("Random Float:", randomFloat)
}
```

Example output might be:

```
Random Integer: 42
Random Float: 0.7304601899194229
```

Remember, each execution produces different numbers due to the seeding with the current time.

## Deep Dive

The `math/rand` package in Go implements pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) for various distributions. While quite effective for many applications, it's crucial to note that the numbers generated by `math/rand` are not suitable for cryptographic purposes due to their deterministic nature. For cryptographic needs, the `crypto/rand` package is the appropriate choice, providing a secure random number generator.

The implementation of `math/rand` is based on a subtractive random number generator algorithm, which is efficient and has a relatively long period before repeating sequences. However, for applications requiring truly random sequences, such as cryptographic operations, hardware random number generators (RNGs) or the `crypto/rand` package, which interfaces with system-specific secure randomness sources, are recommended. 

`math/rand` allows for seeding to introduce variability, but the same seed will always generate the same sequence of numbers, highlighting the deterministic nature of its randomness. This makes it suitable for simulations or games where reproducibility might be desirable for debugging or testing purposes.
