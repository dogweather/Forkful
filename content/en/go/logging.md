## What & Why?
Logging is all about keeping a record of events, states, and data flows within an app. Programmers do it to diagnose bugs, monitor performance, and track the app's operational healthâ€”pretty much making it the software equivalent of a black box in airplanes.

## How to:
In Go, logging can be handled in multiple ways, ranging from the standard library's `log` package to third-party libraries such as `logrus` and `zap`. Here's a simple example using the built-in `log` package:

```Go
package main

import (
	"log"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	// Create a log file
	logFile, err := os.OpenFile("app.log", os.O_CREATE|os.O_APPEND|os.O_WRONLY, 0666)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	defer logFile.Close()

	// Set log output to the file
	log.SetOutput(logFile)

	// Log some events
	log.Println("Starting the application...")
	// ... application logic here ...
	log.Println("Application ended successfully.")
}
```

If you run this code, you won't see any output to the terminal because it's all going into `app.log`. Here's a peek at what you'd find inside that log file:

```
2023/01/02 15:04:05 Starting the application...
2023/01/02 15:05:01 Application ended successfully.
```

## Deep Dive
Logging in programming dates back to the earliest computers, where engineers would literally find bugs (moths, to be exact) squashed in the hardware, and they'd log them! Fast forward to today, and logging has become a sophisticated way to understand what's happening within complex systems.

While the `log` package in Go is quite simplistic, it can be sufficient for basic applications. However, in the context of modern distributed systems, or when you need more nuanced control over your log output (like different levels of severity), you might want to explore more robust solutions.

Third-party logging libraries like `logrus` and `zap` offer structured logging, which means you can log complex data types like JSON, making it easier to interpret logs, especially in conjunction with log management systems like ELK Stack or Splunk.

When considering the implementation of a logging strategy, it's also essential to think about performance implications. High-performance logging libraries are optimized to reduce the impact on the application throughput and latency. For instance, `zap` boasts of its blazing fast, low allocation design, which can be crucial for real-time systems.

In addition to various libraries, logging formats and standards are also worth noting. Structured logging formats like JSON can be immensely powerful when used in conjunction with log processing systems. On the other hand, plain text logs are human-readable but more challenging to parse programmatically.
