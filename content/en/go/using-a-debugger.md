## What & Why?
Using a debugger is like having a GPS in the jungle of code; it guides you to the source of the problem. Programmers use debuggers to step through their code, inspect variables and understand the flow, making it easier to catch bugs and optimize performance.

## How to:
Go has a built-in tool for debugging called Delve (`dlv`). To get started, install Delve, write a simple Go program, and then run it through the debugger.

```Go
// First, install Delve
// go get -u github.com/go-delve/delve/cmd/dlv

// Example Go program, save as main.go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    message := "Debugging with Delve!"
    fmt.Println(message)
}

// Run your program with Delve
// dlv debug

// Some basic Delve commands:
// (dlv) break main.main // set a breakpoint at function main
// (dlv) continue // run until breakpoint or program termination
// (dlv) step // single step through the program
// (dlv) print message // print the current value of variable 'message'
// (dlv) quit // exit Delve
```

Running `dlv debug` starts a debugging session. Once you hit a breakpoint you've set, you can step through your program and see what's going on under the hood.

## Deep Dive
Historically, Go programmers have used several tools for debugging such as GDB (GNU Debugger) but faced challenges because GDB wasn't tailored for Go's runtime and goroutines. Delve came to the rescue with better support for Go's unique features.

There are alternatives to Delve like `go-dbg`, and even integrated debugger support within IDEs like Visual Studio Code and GoLand, which wrap around Delve for a more user-friendly experience.

On the implementation side, Delve works using the `runtime` and `debug/gosym` packages, among others, to access and interpret Go program symbols and runtime information. It is constantly updated to keep up with new language features and versions.
