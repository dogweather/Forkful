## What & Why?

Writing tests in Elm involves crafting test cases to verify the correctness of your Elm code, ensuring it behaves as expected. Programmers do it to catch bugs early, ease maintenance, and improve the quality and reliability of their applications.

## How to: 

Elm uses the `elm-explorations/test` package for writing unit and fuzz tests. Start by adding the package to your project:

```elm
elm install elm-explorations/test
```

Create a test file, say `tests/ExampleTest.elm`, and import the testing modules. Here is a simple test that verifies a function `add : Int -> Int -> Int`:

```elm
module ExampleTest exposing (..)

import Expect
import Test exposing (..)
import YourModuleName exposing (add)

suite : Test
suite =
    describe "A simple addition function"
        [ test "Adding 2 and 3 yields 5" <| 
            \_ -> add 2 3 |> Expect.equal 5
        ]

```

To run your tests, you will need `elm-test`:

```shell
npm install -g elm-test
elm-test
```

This will compile your tests and print the results in your terminal. For the example above, the output should be something like:

```
TEST RUN PASSED

Duration: 42 ms
Passed:   1
Failed:   0
```

For a more complex example, let's say you want to fuzz test the `add` function to ensure it handles a wide range of integer inputs correctly. You would modify your `ExampleTest.elm` as follows:

```elm
module ExampleTest exposing (..)

import Expect
import Fuzz exposing (int)
import Test exposing (..)
import YourModuleName exposing (add)

suite : Test
suite =
    describe "Testing add with fuzzing"
        [ fuzz int "Fuzz testing add with random ints" <| 
            \int1 int2 -> add int1 int2 |> Expect.equal (int1 + int2)
        ]
```

Run `elm-test` again to see the fuzz tests in action. Output will vary with random input but successful tests will indicate no failures:

```
TEST RUN PASSED

Duration: 183 ms
Passed:   100
Failed:   0
``` 

These examples show how to write and run simple unit and fuzz tests in Elm, using the `elm-explorations/test` package. Testing is a vital part of the development process, helping to ensure your Elm applications are reliable and maintain high quality.
