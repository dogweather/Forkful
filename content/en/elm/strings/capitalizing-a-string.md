## What & Why?

Capitalizing a string involves transforming the initial character of a given string to uppercase while keeping the rest in lowercase, often for standardized formatting or readability purposes. Programmers frequently perform this task to ensure data is presented consistently, especially in user interfaces or when processing and displaying user input.

## How to:

In Elm, there isn't a built-in function specifically for capitalizing strings. However, you can achieve this easily by using the built-in `String` module functions like `toUpper`, `toLower`, `left`, and `dropLeft`.

```elm
capitalize : String -> String
capitalize str =
    if String.isEmpty str then
        ""
    else
        String.toUpper (String.left 1 str) ++ String.toLower (String.dropLeft 1 str)

-- Example usage
main =
    String.toList "hello world" |> List.map capitalize |> String.join " "
    -- Output: "Hello World"
```

For more complex scenarios or if you prefer using a library that provides a direct way to capitalize strings, you might consider a third-party package such as `elm-community/string-extra`. However, as of my last update, Elm's ecosystem encourages dealing with such tasks using built-in functions to keep the language and projects lean.

```elm
import String.Extra as StringExtra

-- In case there's a `capitalize` function in a third-party library
capitalizeWithLibrary : String -> String
capitalizeWithLibrary str =
    StringExtra.capitalize str

-- Example usage with hypothetical library function
main =
    "this is elm" |> capitalizeWithLibrary
    -- Hypothetical output: "This is elm"
```

Always check the Elm package repository for the latest and most preferred libraries for string manipulation if you're looking for additional functionality beyond the standard library.
