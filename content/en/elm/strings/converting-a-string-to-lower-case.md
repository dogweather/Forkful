## What & Why?

Converting a string to lowercase means transforming all alphabetical characters to their lower-case form. Programmers often do this for case-insensitive comparisons or normalization of text data for storage and processing.

## How to:

Elm uses the `String.toLower` function to convert text:

```elm
import String

lowercaseString : String -> String
lowercaseString text =
    String.toLower text

-- Usage
result : String
result =
    lowercaseString "HeLLo, WoRLD!"

-- Output: "hello, world!"
```

## Deep Dive

Elm's `String.toLower` comes from Elm's core `String` library, with internationalization taken into account. Historically, case conversion has evolved from basic ASCII to full Unicode support due to the need for international text handling. 

In some languages like Javascript, there are alternatives like `toLowerCase()` and `toLocaleLowerCase()`, where the latter considers locale-specific rules. In Elm, `String.toLower` should suffice for most cases unless dealing with locale-sensitive operations, which might require a custom implementation.

A detail to remember is that case conversion isn't always a one-to-one; some characters may not have a lowercase equivalent, and others may change size (e.g., converting "ÃŸ" in German).
