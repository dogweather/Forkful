## What & Why?
Removing quotes from a string means stripping away those extra double or single quotation marks that you don't actually need in the processed text. Programmers do this to sanitize input, prepare data for storage, or make the output more human-readable when quotes are not necessary for the given context.

## How to:
In Elm, you can use the `String` functions to manipulate strings, such as removing quotes. Here's a straightforward way to do it:

```Elm
removeQuotes : String -> String
removeQuotes str =
    String.trim (String.filter (\char -> char /= '\"' && char /= '\'') str)

main =
    String.removeQuotes "\"This is a 'quoted' string!\""
    -- Output: This is a quoted string!
```

Just remember: this little snippet will remove all quotes from your string, so use it wisely!

## Deep Dive
Back in the day, dealing with strings was a bit more hands-on, involving lots of manual parsing. Nowadays, languages like Elm make it simpler with built-in functions. The function `String.filter` is a versatile tool in your arsenal for when you need to fuss over every character, which includes but is not limited to yanking quotes.

As an alternative, you might roll with regular expressions if Elm were to support them portably, which it doesn't by default. But hey, Elm's focus on simplicity and safety means our `String.filter` approach is clear, safe, and easy to maintain.

Elm's functional approach encourages pure functions without side effects, and `removeQuotes` is a prime example. It takes a string and returns a new one, leaving the original unharmed. That's Elm's immutable data structures at play, promoting predictability and easing your debugging heartache.
