## What & Why?

Creating a temporary file involves setting up a file for short-term use. Programmers use this to store immediate data, handle file-related computations, or test functionality without altering permanent files.

## How to:

As you may know, Elm a pure functional language for the frontend, it is not meant for file handling, and does not support creating temporary files as there are security issues around file handling in browser based languages. Therefore, this operation is usually handled back-end side.

For illustration, we'll use a Node.js example:

```Node.js
const os = require('os');
const fs = require('fs');

const tempFile = os.tmpdir() + '/temp.txt';

fs.writeFile(tempFile, 'This is a temporary file', (err) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log('Temporary file has been created');
});
```

This script first imports `os` and `fs` modules, creates a temporary file path, writes some content to the temporary file, and then outputs a success message.

Note that using any back-end language that fits your need will do just fine. 

## Deep Dive

Creating temporary files has been a necessity in programming since the inception of its concept. It originated in batch processing where programs had to manage multiple data streams simultaneously.

There are alternatives to creating temporary files. Depending on the programming language used, an alternative could be to store the short-term data in memory – although this might not be viable for large data sets due to the limited availability of free memory.

Implementation details of creating a temporary file can vary depending on the system and programming language. In some languages, temporary files are created in specific directory allocated by the operating system, while in others it’s up to the developer to manage the location.
