## What & Why?
Finding the length of a string means counting its characters. Programmers do it to validate inputs, manipulate text, or simply to size up data.

## How to:
In Elm, you use `String.length` to find out how many characters a string contains. Witness:

```elm
import Html exposing (text)

main =
  text (String.fromInt (String.length "Hello, Elm!"))
  -- Output: "11"
```

## Deep Dive
Historically, string length functions have been crucial for memory management and text processing in languages with low-level access to data. Elm, being high level, abstracts these details, offering built-in functionality with `String.length`.

Two points worth noting:
1. Elm strings are UTF-16 encoded. `String.length` returns the number of UTF-16 code units, which can differ from the actual number of Unicode graphemes (user-perceived characters) in strings with complex characters.
2. There aren't built-in alternatives to `String.length` in Elm. If you need the number of graphemes, you might need a custom function that accounts for Unicode intricacies.

Internally, `String.length` iterates over the string data structure, counting elements. As a pure function, its output depends solely on input, maintaining Elm's functional programming ethos.
