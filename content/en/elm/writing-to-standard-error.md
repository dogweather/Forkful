## What & Why?

Writing to standard error (stderr) is about redirecting error messages and diagnostics separate from the main program output, which goes to standard output (stdout). Programmers do it to make error handling and logging more manageable, especially in environments where output distinction is crucial for debugging and monitoring.

## How to:

Elm is primarily targeted at web development, where the concept of writing directly to stderr doesn't apply in the same way as it does in traditional command-line environments. However, for Elm programs running in Node.js or similar environments, interop with JavaScript using ports is the key approach to achieve similar functionality. Here is how you might set it up:

Elm Code (`Main.elm`):
```elm
port module Main exposing (main)

import Browser

port errorOut : String -> Cmd msg

-- Dummy example function that sends an error message to JS
generateError : String -> Cmd msg
generateError message =
    errorOut message

main =
    generateError "This is an error message for stderr"
```

JavaScript Interop (`index.js`):
```javascript
const { Elm } = require('./Main.elm');

var app = Elm.Main.init();

app.ports.errorOut.subscribe((message) => {
  console.error(message);
});
```

This Elm code defines a port `errorOut` that allows sending messages out of Elm to JavaScript. Then in the JavaScript code, we listen for messages sent through this port and redirect them to stderr using `console.error()`. This way, you can effectively write to stderr in an environment that supports it, by leveraging Elm's interop features with JavaScript.

Sample output in Node.js terminal (when `index.js` is run):
```
This is an error message for stderr
```
