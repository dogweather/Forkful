## How to:
Elm does not have built-in support for CSV parsing or generation; instead, third-party packages such as `panosoft/elm-csv` are often utilized. Below examples highlight the basic usage of this library for CSV parsing and generation.

### Parsing CSV
First, you need to add the CSV package to your Elm project:

```bash
elm install panosoft/elm-csv
```

Then, you can parse a CSV string into a list of records. A simple example:

```elm
import Csv

csvData : String
csvData =
    "name,age\nJohn Doe,30\nJane Smith,25"

parseResult : Result String (List (List String))
parseResult =
    Csv.parse csvData

-- Sample output: Ok [["name","age"],["John Doe","30"],["Jane Smith","25"]]
```

### Generating CSV
To generate a CSV string from Elm data, use the `Csv.encode` function:

```elm
import Csv

records : List (List String)
records =
    [ ["name", "age"]
    , ["John Doe", "30"]
    , ["Jane Smith", "25"]
    ]

csvOutput : String
csvOutput =
    Csv.encode records

-- Sample output: "name,age\nJohn Doe,30\nJane Smith,25\n"
```

This simplistic approach enables you to integrate CSV functionalities within your Elm applications, leveraging the type-safe environment for data manipulation and exchange.
