summary: Parsing a date from a string in Elm involves converting textual information
  representing dates and times into a format that Elm can understand and manipulate,
  specifically into the `Date` type.

## How to:
Elm does not have built-in capabilities as robust as some other languages for date parsing, primarily relying on Javascript interop or libraries for more complex operations. However, you can use the `elm/time` package for basic parsing, and for more complex needs, the third-party `justinmimbs/date` library is widely recommended.

### Parsing using `elm/time`:
`elm/time` provides the `Time` module, which allows you to work with timestamps instead of human-readable dates. While it does not directly parse dates from strings, you can convert an ISO 8601 string into a POSIX timestamp, which you can then work with.

```elm
import Time exposing (Posix)

-- Assuming you have an ISO 8601 date string
isoDateStr : String
isoDateStr = "2023-01-01T00:00:00Z"

-- Convert it to a POSIX timestamp (this function returns a `Result`)
parsedDate : Result String Posix
parsedDate = Time.fromIsoString8601 isoDateStr

-- Sample output: Ok <posix time value>
```

### Parsing using `justinmimbs/date`:
For more intricate parsing, like dealing with non-ISO formats, `justinmimbs/date` library is a great choice. Here's how you can use it to parse a custom date string:

1. Ensure you have the library installed:

```shell
elm install justinmimbs/date
```

2. Use the `Date.fromString` function to parse custom date formats:

```elm
import Date
import Result exposing (Result(..))

-- Let's say you have a custom date string format `dd-MM-yyyy`
customDateStr : String
customDateStr = "01-01-2023"

-- Function to parse the custom format
parseDate : String -> Result String Date.Date
parseDate = Date.fromString "dd-MM-yyyy"

-- Sample usage
parsedCustomDate : Result String Date.Date
parsedCustomDate = parseDate customDateStr

-- Sample output: Ok (Date.fromCalendarDate 2023 Jan 1)
```

In these examples, the `Result` type encapsulates either a successful parsing that yields a date (`Ok`) or an error (`Err`), enabling robust error handling in your Elm applications.
