## What & Why?
Organizing code into functions means breaking down the beast of a program into manageable chunks, each doing a distinct task. Programmers do this to make code readable, reusable, and maintainable.

## How to:
Here's a classic example â€” a function to calculate the factorial of a number.

```java
public class MathUtils {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int number = 5;
        int result = factorial(number);
        System.out.println("Factorial of " + number + " is: " + result);
    }
    
    public static int factorial(int n) {
        if (n <= 1) {
            return 1;
        }
        return n * factorial(n - 1);
    }
}
```

Output would be:
```
Factorial of 5 is: 120
```

## Deep Dive
Before functions were a thing, code was crammed into monolithic blocks, making debugging like finding a needle in a haystack. Now, encapsulating functionality into functions helps isolate issues fast. Alternatives include lambda expressions in Java or methods in object-oriented programming, both serving similar purposes. When you write a function, remember: (1) Each function should have a single responsibility and (2) the name of the function should clearly describe its purpose.
