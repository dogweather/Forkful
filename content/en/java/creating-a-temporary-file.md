## Why

Temporary files are useful in any programming language, especially in Java, when you need to store and retrieve data at run time. They provide a convenient and secure way to handle temporary data without permanently storing it on a computer.

## How To

Creating a temporary file in Java is a straightforward process. Here is an example code block showing how to create a temporary file using the `File` and `FileWriter` classes:

```Java
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;

public class TempFileExample {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    try {
      // Create a temporary file using File class
      File tempFile = File.createTempFile("temp", ".txt");

      // Write some data to the temporary file using FileWriter class
      FileWriter writer = new FileWriter(tempFile);
      writer.write("This is a temporary file.");
      writer.close();

      // Print the path of the temporary file
      System.out.println("Temporary file created at: " + tempFile.getAbsolutePath());
    } catch (IOException e) {
      e.printStackTrace();
    }
  }
}
```
The output of the above code would be:
```
Temporary file created at: /var/folders/6c/8l.../temp5270823443595276810.txt
```

In the above code, we first import the necessary classes from the `java.io` package. Then, we use the `File.createTempFile()` method to create a temporary file with the specified prefix and suffix. Next, we use the `FileWriter` class to write some data to the temporary file, and finally, we print the absolute path of the temporary file.

## Deep Dive

When creating a temporary file, there are some important things to keep in mind. Firstly, the prefix of the temporary file must be at least three characters long, and the file's suffix must include a period. This ensures that the file is uniquely named and avoids any naming conflicts with existing files.

Additionally, the temporary file is automatically deleted when the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) terminates. However, it is best practice to manually delete the temporary file once it is no longer needed to free up resources. This can be done using the `File.delete()` method.
