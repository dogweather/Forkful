## How to:
Reading a file is a breeze in Java, especially with `java.nio.file`. Here's a quick example:

```java
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.stream.Stream;

public class FileReadExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Path filePath = Path.of("example.txt");

        try (Stream<String> lines = Files.lines(filePath)) {
            lines.forEach(System.out::println);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

Running this with `example.txt` containing "Hello, file readers!" would output:

```
Hello, file readers!
```

## Deep Dive
Java has evolved. Back in the day, you'd have to manage streams and readers yourself â€“ plenty of boilerplate. The `java.io` package was all the rage, with `FileReader` and `BufferedReader` often seen in the wild. Then came `java.nio`, offering channels and buffers for more control.

Now, `java.nio.file` is even higher level. `Files` and `Paths` simplify the job. The example above uses `Files.lines`, which streams lines lazily, great for big files. You also get try-with-resources, automatically closing streams to avoid leaks.

Alternatives? `Scanner` is handy for parsing. Apache Commons IO and Google's Guava have utilities for more complex tasks, if you need them. Still, vanilla Java usually gets you pretty far.

Implementation-wise, file encoding matters. `Files.lines` assumes UTF-8 by default but you can specify another. On the other hand, `BufferedReader` needs you to set the `Charset` upfront if it's not the default.
