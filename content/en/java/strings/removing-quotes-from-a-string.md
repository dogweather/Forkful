## What & Why?
Removing quotes from a string means stripping out any quotation marks—single (' '), double (" "), or both—from the text data. Programmers do it to sanitize inputs, prepare data for storage, or simplify parsing tasks where quotes are unnecessary and potentially problematic.

## How to:
Let's yank those pesky quotes out of our text. We'll use `replace()` method for the quick fixes and regex for the tough nuts to crack.

```java
public class QuoteRemover {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String stringWithQuotes = "\"Hello, 'World'!\"";
        String withoutQuotes = stringWithQuotes.replace("\"", "").replace("'", "");
        System.out.println(withoutQuotes); // Hello, World!

        // Now with regex for the pattern aficionados
        String stringWithMixedQuotes = "\"Java\" and 'Programming'";
        String cleanString = stringWithMixedQuotes.replaceAll("[\"']", "");
        System.out.println(cleanString); // Java and Programming
    }
}
```

## Deep Dive
Back in the day, quotes in strings weren't too much of a bother—systems were simpler, and data wasn't as messy. With the advent of complex data formats (JSON, XML) and the need for data exchange, quote management became key. Speaking of alternatives, sure, you could write a parser, loop through each character, and build a new string (might be fun on a rainy day). There are also third-party libraries that can handle this with more sophistication, providing options to escape characters instead of removing them, or to handle different types of quotation marks according to locale. Implementation-wise, bear in mind removing quotes without context can change the meaning or structure of data—always consider the "why" before the "how".
