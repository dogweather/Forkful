## How to:
Java uses exceptions to handle errors. You surround risky code with a `try` block and catch exceptions with `catch`. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```java
public class ErrorHandlingExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            int result = divide(10, 0);
            System.out.println("Result is: " + result);
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            System.out.println("Oops, can't divide by zero!");
        }
    }

    private static int divide(int numerator, int denominator) {
        return numerator / denominator;
    }
}
```

Output:
```
Oops, can't divide by zero!
```

## Deep Dive
Error handling in Java has evolved. Early days didn't have exceptions; programmers checked error codes. Then Java introduced try-catch blocks, allowing more elegant error handling.

Alternatives to traditional `try-catch` include `try-with-resources` for auto-closing resources and cleaner code, introduced in Java 7.

Implementation details matter. For example, catching `Exception` or `Throwable` is usually bad practice. It's too broad, masking bugs you might not be aware of. Stick to specific exceptions.
