## What & Why?
Comparing two dates means finding out if one date comes before, after, or is the same as another. Programmers do this to handle scheduling, deadlines, chronological sorting, and more.

## How to:
Java makes life pretty easy when comparing dates. Use `LocalDate` and `compareTo`, `isBefore`, or `isAfter` methods. Here's the skinny:

```java
import java.time.LocalDate;

public class DateComparison {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LocalDate date1 = LocalDate.of(2023, 4, 1);
        LocalDate date2 = LocalDate.now(); // assuming today is 2023-4-15

        // Using compareTo
        int comparisonResult = date1.compareTo(date2);
        if(comparisonResult < 0) {
            System.out.println("Date1 is before Date2");
        } else if (comparisonResult > 0) {
            System.out.println("Date1 is after Date2");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Date1 is same as Date2");
        }

        // Using isBefore and isAfter
        if(date1.isBefore(date2)) {
            System.out.println("Date1 is earlier than Date2");
        } else if(date1.isAfter(date2)) {
            System.out.println("Date1 is later than Date2");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Date1 is the same day as Date2");
        }
    }
}
```

Sample output for today's date as 2023-04-15:

```
Date1 is before Date2
Date1 is earlier than Date2
```

## Deep Dive
Historically, Java's date handling was, well, a headache. But then came Java 8 with `java.time`, a game-changer. Now we use `LocalDate` for dates sans time. Wanna compare dates including time? Look to `LocalDateTime`.

Alternatives? Sure. Before Java 8, there was `java.util.Date` and `java.util.Calendar`. You could still use them, but why dig your own grave?

Implementation-wise, `compareTo` returns `int`: negative if calling object is less (before), zero if equal, positive if greater (after). `isBefore` and `isAfter` return `boolean`. Easy to grasp, and no gotchas.
