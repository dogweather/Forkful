## What & Why?

Converting a date to a string means representing a date object as readable text that follows a specific pattern. Programmers do this to display dates to users or to serialize them for storage and networking in a human-friendly format.

## How to:

Java makes date-to-string conversion straightforward. The `java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter` class is your go-to. Here's a code example:

```java
import java.time.LocalDate;
import java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter;

public class DateToStringExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LocalDate date = LocalDate.now(); // Today's date
        DateTimeFormatter formatter = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("dd/MM/yyyy");
        String dateString = date.format(formatter);
        System.out.println(dateString); // Output could be: 20/03/2023, for instance
    }
}
```

## Deep Dive

Historically, Java used `SimpleDateFormat` from the `java.text` package, but it wasn't thread-safe and led to bugs. With Java 8, the `java.time` package brought thread-safe and immutable date-time classes. The `DateTimeFormatter` is part of this modern package.

There are alternatives like `FastDateFormat` from Apache Commons and `DateUtils` from various libraries. Yet, most Java devs stick with the standard library, which is robust and versatile.

When formatting, `DateTimeFormatter` uses patterns `yyyy` for the year, `MM` for the month, and `dd` for the day. It can handle pretty complex patterns, even locale-specific ones, with its `ofPattern` method. It's also worth noting that `DateTimeFormatter` is immutable and thread-safe, so you can use the same formatter instance across multiple threads without any synchronization headache.
