## What & Why? (Co & Dlaczego?)
Tworzenie pliku tymczasowego to proces kreowania miejsca na dane, które są potrzebne tylko przez chwilę. Robimy to, bo zapewnia to bezpieczeństwo (nikt inny nie ma do nich dostępu) i porządek w systemie plików, zwłaszcza kiedy dane nie są już potrzebne.

## How to (Jak to zrobić)
C provides the `tmpfile()` function to create a unique temporary file that's automatically deleted when the program ends. Let's see how it works:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    FILE *tmp = tmpfile();
    if (tmp == NULL) {
        perror("Unable to create temporary file");
        return 1;
    }
    
    fputs("This is a temporary file content.", tmp);

    // Do something with the file here...
    // When done, the file is closed automatically when the program terminates

    return 0;
}
```
No sample output is really needed here since the temporary file isn't going to hang around.

## Deep Dive (Głębsza eksploracja)
Historically, temporary files were managed manually, with designers explicitly choosing file names, which could lead to clashes. The `tmpfile()` function, provided by the ISO C standard, removes this hassle by guaranteeing a unique file that doesn't conflict with any other file and is deleted upon program completion.

Alternatives? Sure. You could use `mkstemp()` or `tmpnam()` to have more control over the file's properties and lifetime, or you can directly work with the file system, but that's complex territory. When dealing with highly sensitive data, though, be extra cautious as temp files may not be securely erased.

As for implementation, `tmpfile()` creates the file in a system-specified temp directory. The function uses a combination of pid (process ID) and/or a unique sequence to generate the name, preventing naming conflicts and providing a degree of safety. On UNIX-like systems, this often links to `/tmp`.
